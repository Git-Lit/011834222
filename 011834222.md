of Gujarat in this respect are certainly not inferior to
those of the Dekkan. The annual revenue from land which
flows into the Imperial Exchequer from the Southern Division
is Rs. 1,53,29,214, whereas that from the Northern Division is
Rs. 1,61.98,195. It may be that the physical characteristics os
these two large divisions of Western India have to some extent
to do with their peculiar irrigation facilities. But whereas the
soil of the Dekkan and Southern Maratha Country renders an
extensive outlay for irrigation necessary, the cost of carrying
out irrigation projects in Gujarat would be infinitely less.
Gujarat possesses noble rivers, such as the Nerbudda, the Taptee,
the Saburmutty, of which the waters roll on in ceaseless course
in millions of tons to waste every second in twenty-four hours.
And yet they have not been converted to the use or comfort of
man, simply because of the ignorance of the children of the soil
and the perversity or indifference of an enlightened Government.
We are not unconscious of many difficulties in carrying out
locally schemes of irrigation in Gujarat. Some of these may
appear to be of insuperable character, but surely the subject
deserves the most careful attention on the part of the authorities.
Practically, nothing has been done in Gujarat for irrigation.
The Taptee project by which it was proposed to put an irrigation
dam across the river, and to lead off canals to different parts of
the Surat Collectorate, was reported upon in 1860 by Captain
Chambers. The conclusions which Captain Chambers came to
in the report, stated in his own words, are :—


\"1st.—That the Taptee is a river with excellent sites for an
-' irrigation dam, and the country under the command of such
\"a dam is well suited for irrigation.


\"2nd.—That there is water enough in the river for, at least,
-• 200,000 acres of land, from the middle of June to the 1st of
•' December, if not longer, and there are on both banks of the
\"river, 200,000 acres of land, so situated as to be perfectly
•■ irrigable.


\"3rd.—That the proposed scheme of combined irrigation and
-• navigation is a perfectly easy one from an engineering point of
\"view, but expensive owing to the heavy cuttings at the heads
<!-- Leaf 81, Page: 71 -->
acre, in the other at only Rs. 1. Should it be found on a revision of the
settlement, that in the 2nd village also 100 acres have been brought
under wet crop cultivation from the river, the water rates in the 2
villages might be equalised. Nor could the people adduce Section XXX.
of the Survey Act in objection to this, the whole of the irrigable lands
having been originally classed as bagayut.


\"J4. This leads me to a consideration of para. 10 of the Survey
Commissioner's letter as stated by Major Francis, no " general ruling"
to the effect that lands irrigated by wells built after the introduction
of the settlement will be exempt from bagayut assessment, has been
published. But surely the existing law is explicit enough on this point
It is enacted by Section XXX. of Act I. of 1865, that the ' revised
assessment shall be fixed not with reference to improvements made from
private capital and resources during the currency of any settlement
under the Act, but wich reference to general considerations, whether as
to soil and situation,'&c. The meaning of this seems to me to be
perfectly clear. The permanency of the classification has not been
guaranteed by the Act, lest Government should be debarred from
correcting errors on the expiry of the period for which the settlements are
guaranteed. But they are debarred from taking advantage of the
improvements made by one man to raise the rate of assessment upon his
lands beyond that which may be fixed for the lands of others who have
made no improvements. Thus, if we through error assess only at
drycrop rates a tract of land like those described in paragraph 6 above, the
settling officer on a revision might legally assess the whole of it at
garden rates. But he could not say to two holders of land within such
a tract : ' You, Ramjee, have built a permanent well during the currency
of the last settlement, and your field will therefore be assessed at garden
rates. Yo j, Raojee, have done nothing to improve your land, and will
therefore continue to pay dry-crop rates.' The importance of this
principle seems to me to be so great, that I hope the Survey
Commissioner has here misinterpreted the Survey Act.


"15. The 4th and last class of garden lands are dry-crop lands,
rendered irrigable by the construction, at considerable expense, of
permanent wells. It is with regard to the mode of assessing these lands that
Mr. Ellis observes that its defects are ' want of simplicity, liability to
evasion, and inequality of incidence' objections which Major Francis,
from what he has heard, thinks incident to the system adopted in this
Survey and to no other.


\"16. The system of assessing land higher than it would otherwise
be assessed, because its owner has at his own expense constructed a well
to irrigate it, is of course open to objections so grave, that in the
Punjaub, this source of revenue has 1 believe been entirely abandoned, and
in Bombay, if I am right in my interpretation of Section XXX. of the

proprietor increased, his estate came to be subdivided among
several sons in accordance with the principles of Hindu
inheritance. The Pdtis or shares became too numerous, but still
the phalani or distribution of the amount payable by each
sharer was regulated according to his share in the village
lands, irrespective of its being small or great, that is to say,
whether it comprised more or less extent of land. Strangers
were often allowed to share in the proprietary rights. The
subsharers had the same rights and privileges as the large
proprietors. They were called Patels and Pdtiddrs equally as the large
sharers. In all the general affairs of the village, however, the
head of each family represented the interests of the sub-sharers.
He was called Mutdddr, from Muttoo, signifying signature, as
he had to sign village documents on behalf of the family. The
position of Mutadars was considered to be one of great respect
in the village community. So jealously has it come to be
watched to this day in Bhagdari villages in Gujarat, that if
Government were to appoint to the office of a revenue or police
patel, a person from the non-proprietary body—though the
distinction has hardly been recognized of late—it would be looked
upon as an infringement of their hereditary right and be
bitterly complained of as a gross injustice done to them.


The position of the non-proprietary class was of a two-fold
character. While there were many who held lands at the
pleasure of the Bhagdars, there were others* whose long
occupancy constituted a sufficient consideration for allowing them a
continuance of lease so long as they met the customary demands
of the State. There is, however, an important social
difference between a Kunbi or the non-proprietary cultivator and the
Patidar which must not be lost sight of, especially in a province
so caste-ridden as Gujarat is. A Patidar enjoys a high social
status in his village. Poor as he may be he can easily get his
son married—a great social consideration among Hindoos. The
Kunbi cultivator may bo more highly placed in point of wealth,
but in a competition between himself and the Patidar, the latter
is sure to beat the former down. Again, the credit of the Patidar
stands much higher with the general community. The Soukar

I am alluding to a result of the preliminary difficulty there was ii.
equalising the assessment in the Neriad talook, where assessment by
caste had been greatly the practice before tbe introduction of the
settlement, and which led to some lands being assessed higher under the
revenue survey system than was previously the case. This had to be
done to equalise assessment throughout the talook, and for other and
equally just reasons, and your correspondent has taken this sort of fact
by itself as proof of the unfairness of the assessment. He will find if
he cuts his finger deep enough that there is something more above and
below it than skin.


As to his allegation, that wrong has been done to individual ryots
who had specific agreements with Government to run over a specified
time, the officers who made the settlement acknowledged such
agreements wherever they were fairly urged; and in cases where such
agreements have been overlooked, through miscarriage of any kind, ara I
not here, Sir, in Kaira to enquire into such cases, and to acknowledge
whatever Government obligations there may be ? And am I not, Sir,

  TO THE EDITOR OF THE " TIMES OF INDIA."


Sir,—I see you publish in your paper of 28th instant a letter from Mr.
{empty}G. W. Elliot, Acting Collector of Kaira. It purposes to notice my
complaint regarding extra assessment on account of well-irrigation in Neriad
talooka. I had heartily desired to be set right in regard to my
complaint, if I was ill-informed on the subject, by so high an authority as
the Acting Collector of Kaira, who possesses means of information
which are certainly beyond my reach. But, instead of giving me, or the
public, the benefit of his superior knowledge of revenue affairs, by
replying in a straightforward manner, His Honor is pleased to pour
down upon my head a hot bath, full of angry words and statements,
thereby trying to fulfil, what he is delighted to call, ' a public duty.'
For the first time in my life, Mr. Editor, I am taught by Mr. Elliot that
' fulfilling a public duty' consists, not in dispassionately discussing a
public question with an opponent, correcting him where he is mistaken,
but in iudulging in violent language as if this was the easiest mode of
carrying conviction home to him. I am sorry I cannot accept the

Acttion, the extent of the country likely to be supplied with water
by each, and the difficulties, great or small, which would have
to be encountered in carrying out a thorough scheme of irrigation,
together with an estimate of the outlay required for such
purposes. But excepting that on the Taptee river no other reports
of Captain Chambers on the rivers of Gujarat have seen light.


Next to rivers, another source of irrigation is streamlets, lakes,
ponds, reservoirs, &c, of which there are plenty in all the zillas.
The land which receives its supply of water from these as well as
from large rivers is of two kinds—the Bhatta land, which is
mostly of a rich alluvial character, and the Kyari or rice land.
The Bhatta land is the most fertile, owing to the alluvial deposits
which are washed away on it from neighbouring rivers, and
produces the finest crops of sugar-cane, plantains, ginger, pine
apples, and potherbs. There are two ways of irrigating such
lands. One is by means of Dhekoories, a very simple mode of
thawing water. It is used principally in Ahmedabad zilla, and
to a certain extent in Kaira. The other mode of irrigating is
by means of kutcha wells.


These two descriptions of land form what may be called
natural bagayet, or garden lands. They form, however, a very
small proportion, and for obvious natural advantages, are heavily
assessed. Artificial irrigation, however, is carried on in
Gujarat on a large scale. This is done chiefly by means of wells sunk
by the ryots. In fact, irrigation by means of wells is the
principal mode which is practised extensively in Gujarat. It is
simple and inexpensive, and is eminently suited to the habits of
the cultivator.


In different parts of Gujarat, water is accessible at different
depths. In the Surat Collectorate the depth varies from 30 to
50 ft.; in the Broach zilla from 55 to 75 ft.; in the Kaira zilla
from 80 to 100 ft.; and in the Ahmedabad territory from 70 to
90 ft. It is obvious that the greater the depth and the harder
the bed of earth through which the supply of water is obtainable,
the greater is the cost of sinking wells. Accordingly, where
water is easily accessible, as in the talookas of the Surat
Collectorate, recourse is had to what are called Kutcha wells, which  
  
  
  I
<!-- Leaf 22, Page: 12 -->
and registering them in the records of Government, and
determined the rates which should be payable by lands according to
their qualities.


During the period of the Maratha rule in Gujarat, a most
obnoxious system of levying the demands of Government was
introduced. This was the farming of the State revenue-;.
Whatever may be said of the Marathas in other respects, in
Gujarat they were simple plunderers. Whole mahals and
talookas were given away with civil and criminal jurisdictions
over them to the person who made the highest bid. A more
perfect system of auction was never known before in the country.
It was of course the business of the successful bidder to see that
he was in no way a loser by the game. He in turn farmed the
smaller talookas and villages to others at a handsome premium.
Thus farming and sub-farming formed the chief feature of the
Maratha revenue system in Gujarat. The Peishwa was either
too loath or, perhaps, too lazy to superintend the collection of
revenue in person, or by means of his officers, and the meanest
servant had the advantage of becoming the lord of many lakhs
by outbidding other competitors. The result of all this was to
rackrent the ryots, to undermine all their sources of happiness,
and to turn them into miserable wretches. The peasantry, who
paid direct revenues to the State, broke down under the
pressure of the screw which was thus applied to them in a most
extortionate manner^ Whole villages were deserted, and the
powerful farmers had thus an excellent opportunity afforded
them of becoming proprietors of lands and villages thus deserted.

that the Survey is responsible for the soil turning " Khar" which it is
continually doing in many parts of Gujarat and the North Western
Provinces.

taxation. But we contend that Government, in justice to the ryots who
have already expended private capital in constructing wells, is bound to
give a retrospective effect to this provision. According to the present
system of assessment, all wells, which existed at the time of the new
survey, have been held liable to a water rate. The lands of a village
are first surveyed, and a note is taken of all wells which are situated in
them. The survey officers next proceed to classify the soils. Such soils
as are irrigated by wells, are separated from those as have no wells sunk
within their limits. The former are then subjected to garden-crop rates
which include an extra cess on water; whereas the latter are charged
dry-crop rates. Two considerations thus mainly influence the assessment :
the intrinsic value of the soil, and the extrinsic value conferred by
water. Now, if the extrinsic value of the soil was due to any action on
thepartof Government, there would, indeed, be some justification for
it to charge an extra cess on water. But the ryots of Neriad talooka,
and, indeed, of the whole of Kaira and other zillas, can show, in the clearest
manner possible, that Government has not contributed a farthing towards
obtaining the facilities of a water supply in tbe form of wells; that these
wells were constructed by them, or their forefathers, out of their private
capita], in fact, out of their annual savings; that, bad it not been for
this outlay of capital on their part, there would not have been a single
well, in the place of so many which you see at present; and that, even
the repairs of these wells have been carried out by them out of their
private resources. What right, then, has Government to this extra
assessment ou well-water?


But it is not merely of the injustice that the ryot in the Kaira and
other zillas has been complaining. He feels that Government has broken
its faith with him. Such lands as are now charged with garden-rates
were, before the settlement, subject only to dry-crop rates. By a
circular of 1827, issued to the cultivators of the Kaira zilla by Mr. Thomas
Williamson, all cultivators, who injected wells into lands held under
Goverument, were exempted from the payment of garden assessment
rates. Now, this circular demonstrates most clearly that, even at that
early period of its rule, Government was solicitous to allow the ryot the
full benefit of the improvements worked out by him—improvements
which enabled him not merely to profit himself, but to meet the demands
of Government without fail.


It may, perhaps, be urged that the pledge conveyed in this circular
was binding upon Government only for 30 years, on the expiration of
which it was perfectly competent to it to levy a garden assessment. To
this it may be replied, 1st, that the interval between the expiration of
this period, and the period of the introduction of the new survey,
comprised a very short time, during and after which Government was bound
to observe its pledge under the new settlement, especially as the
<!-- Leaf 59, Page: 49 -->
prospechaving the item of cess already recorded in the papers, it would
be a most easy thing to strike off the item by referring to them.
Now it is plain that this has nothing to do with the principle which
underlies and which, I think, should guide the assessment of
artificially irrigated lands. The State, as the great landlord, is, in
my opinion, not entitled to other than jeerayut rates upon all lands
held from it, except in the ease of natural Bagayut lands—
by far a very small proportion in Gujarat,—where the water
supply hardly costs the cultivator more than the labor to dig
a hole in his field and obtain it. Nothing at all events is
more clear than that the present principle resulting in an undue
pressure upon the industry of a most active class of cultivators,
is hardly justifiable either on the ground of fairness or expediency.


We pass on to another subject, viz., the pressure oiwell-taœ or
Bagayut Kussur as it is called, in the language of the Survey
Department, on produce. The average kussur on good irrigated
lands capable of producing a first crop of rice, and a second crop
of wheat is Rs. 9 per acre. As the first crop is a monsoon crop,
no artificial irrigation is necessary to raise it, and so the weight of
the well assessment falls entirely on the second crop, which is the
one raised by means of well-water. Now the value of the
produce of an acre of irrigated land sown with wheat is as under:—


\"Wheat, 25 Gujarat maunds (about 1000 lbs.) at Rs. 2J per maund
fetch Rs. 62-8; Straw Rs. 3-8—Total Rs. 66."


This gives the proportion or about 14 per cent, as the
pressure of the well-tax,—a proportion more than four times the
present rate of income tax in India. Besides this, when we
consider that the cultivator has to pay the land tax, the local
cess, the interest on the capital employed in sinking the well,
the labour employed in raising the produce, what is there that
is left to him but a very paltry amount wherewith to support his
children and to meet the ordinary demands of mere existence ?
Very little, indeed. Our Settlement officers being in receipt of
high salaries and finding respectable living an easy matter, are
apt to forget that the weight of the various assessments the
cultivator has to pay crushes him down. When three per
cent income tax touches the pockets of these officers sorely, what  
  
  
  7
<!-- Leaf 53, Page: 43 -->
the recommendation based upon it, would be valid, if the
assumption were true. But nothing could be further from the fact than
that water throughout all the zillas of Gujarat is obtainable at a
depth of from 20 to 30 ft. The assertion at best is only partially
true, and that too of a limited tract in the Surat Collectorate to
which Major Prescott points for illustrating his general
statement. But Surat is not the whole of Gujarat any more than
Oomret or Ore in the Kaira zilla is, where water is hardly
accessible under 150 to 200 ft^below the surface of the soil. Major
Prescott's error lies in affirming of the whole of Gujarat what
is only partially true of a tract in the zilla of Surat. His general
conclusion about the water facilities ot Gujarat, namely, that
in Gujarat everybody can procure w*ater at little expense,
thus utterly falls to the ground.


Again, in determining the cost of pucka wells in Gujarat, the
Major falls into exactly the same error, namely, that of taking
Surat as the standard for deciding as to the cost of pucka wells
in Gujarat. Everybody acquainted with Gujarat knows, or
ought to know, that the further you go in the northern direction
the greater is the depth at which water becomes accessible, that
in the Kaira zilla especially, the cost of making strong
permanent masonry wells is something between Rs. 1,200 and Rs. 2,500
per erch well, and it is upon the owners of these wells especially,
that the tax works most oppressively.


Next, we have the proposal of Mr. Ellis, who was, at the
date of the correspondence, Revenue Commissioner of the
Northern Division. He evidently admits "that the taxation
of wells not constructed by the State is a deviation from
the broad principles of the Bombay Survey. All wells
built hereafter by individuals will be free from taxation :
it seems hard that wells similarly built by individuals,
but before the advent of the Survey, should be placed
at a disadvantage and subjected to heavier taxation for no
reason save that their owners were in advance of their neighbours
in employing their capital in agriculture.'1'1 He, however, justifies
the levy of a small tax where water is easily to be had. " On
the other hand," says he, " it is quite consistent with the

  THE WELL-ASSESSMENT CONTROVERSY.


To comprehend the merits of the issues involved in this
controversy in such a manner as to be able to pronounce upon
them with some degree of confidence, it is necessary, first of all,
to understand what the controversy really is. And as this
demands some acquaintance on the part of the enquirer with the
mode by which wells are assessed and the Government land
revenue determined, it may not be superfluous to mention a
few of the leading operations connected with the subject. The
land settlement in this Presidency, which, properly speaking, is
a field assessment, and in which is included the separate
assessment on wells, consists of four operations respectively denoted
by the terms Demarkation, Survey, Classification, and
Assessment. Each of these processes involves a long and arduous
work, tasking to the full the energies of the Survey and
Settlement Department which presides over it. First of all the
boundaries of a field have to be ascertained and duly marked
out. An earthen mound is placed at each of the principal
corners of a field to indicate its boundary and to avoid
disputes respecting it. Preservation of these field boundaries is
strictly enjoined on owners and occupants, any breach in
this respect being visited with fine or damages. The next
operation consists of surveying the field, that is to say,
measuring its length and breadth and determining its superficial
area. This is followed by an enquiry into the character of the
soil, different descriptions of soils being classified according to
their capabilities. This is the work of classers—men
specially trained for the work. In the case of a field containing a
well, it is the duty of the classer to ascertain the quality of the
water and to put down its classification according as it is sweet,
brackish, or salt. All papers regarding the demarkation, survey,
measurement, and classification of soils, being thus prepared,
are_forwarded to the settling officers, who have, if not the most
difficult, certainly the most responsible and delicate part of the
<!-- Leaf 62, Page: 52 -->
drought or famine which may at any time desolate the whole
province. The Bombay Government has just now a most
important duty to perform. The Government of India has, as the reader
must be aware, proposed a scheme to aid permanent works of
agriculture by offering to make, under proper security, Viccavie
advances to the agriculturists. The class of works for which
advances are to be made are wells, and other works for the storage
and distribution of water for agricultural purposes; drainage;
the reclaiming of land from rivers; the reclaiming of land from
floods; the reclaiming of waste lands, &c, &c.


The system of tuecavie advances has more or less been in vogue
in this Presidency, but of late it has hardly been much availed
of, and it is doubtful whether, with the terms proposed for the
securities to be offered to Government, many cultivators will at
all be induced to receive any advances. But what the
Government cannot hope to carry out by such offers, it can succeed
remarkably well in promoting irrigation works by abandoning the
cess altogether as being iniquitous in principle, and obnoxious
in operation and as acting as a positive check to agricultural
improvement. The removal of this most unpopular impost will at
once afford a stimulus to every cultivator in Gujarat and the
Dekkan, and will do more for advancing agriculture than any
other inducements which government may hold out. This can
be done without much sacrifice of revenue. At any rate any
sacrifice of revenue herein involved will be more than amply
compensated for by the impetus which the measure will give to
garden cultivation, so sadly neglected at present in Gujarat,
notwithstanding the peculiar facilities that are there for it.


In conclusion it may be mentioned here that the writer has no
private ends to serve by calling in question the policy of
Government in respect of the well assessment of irrigated lands in
Gujarat. He has only been grieved to find that the simple object of
the Survey Settlement Department not to cause a loss to the
land revenue of Government should utterly blind them to the
injustice or inexpediency of levying a cess which is a positive
obstacle to the extension and improvement of agricultural
resources and the growing well-being of the ryots in Gujarat.

  II.  
  
  
  LAND TENURES.


The introduction into Gujarat of a revised settlement in
accordance with the principles of the New Survey, without
giving offence to the people or causing discontent amongst them,
was by no means an easy matter. To avoid anything of the
kind, the first thing necessary was to obtain accurate
information regarding the existing land tenures of the Province.
Accordingly, in the Resolution of the BombayGovernment, No.4,255,
dated 30th October 1856, sanctioning a survey and
assessment of the Bhagdari villages, Government deferred the question
of settlement till the result of a full enquiry into the nature of
the existing tenures was submitted for further consideration.
The task of reporting on them devolved, as we said before, upon
Mr. W. G.Pedder, then employed as Assistant Survey Settlement
Officer in Gujarat. Mr. Pedder's Report appears as the first in
the correspondence before us. It is an able and interesting paper,
giving in as concise a manner as possible the mature results of
his enquiries, not only into the Bhagdari tenures, but into the
general subject of the ancient village system as it has obtained in
Gujarat. As we cannot go fully into all the details supplied by
Mr. Pedder, we shall here present a rapid general sketch of the
origin, nature, and history of the tenures as they exist in Gujarat.


The history of rural Gujarat yields to that of no other
province of India in point of interest, whether we look to the wealth
of its resources, the fertility of its soil, the skill of its cultivators,
or the general character of the people. By far the largest
proportion of population is agricultural or engaged in occupations
accessory to agriculture. The materials for a rural history are
not, however, easily accessible. They lie scattered partly
amongst the traditions of the people, which it would require no
ordinary amount of diligence and patience to collect, and are
partly buried in the archives of Government offices in the
respective zillas. Thelatter source of information is perhaps more
valuable than the former, and is certainly more reliable in point of

imposition of an extra assessment on all land having natural water bearing
capabilities, I do myself the honour to forward a few remarks which
occur to me on a perusal of Major Francis' No. 12, of the 25th ultimo,
a copy of which has been forwarded to this Office for information.


{empty}2. It is evident, from the instructions issued by Mr. Ellis to the
Superintendent to the effect that the classing assistants should note what
fields should be subjected to the special assessment, that he did not quite
share the feeling of confidence with which Captain Prescott described
the grouping of villages for water as " not at all difficult," " because the
water bearing stratum and the quality of water run very even in Gujarat
over certain known tracts." I have known many instances in Gujarat
where the very contrary of this is the case, where of two wells side by
side or only a few yards apart, the one would be sweet and the other so
brackish as to be unfit for purposes of irrigation, and where the mere
cleaning out of a sweet well or deepening it but a very little would
allow a salt spring to break in and spoil the water. As far as my
experience goes, Captain Prescott's assertion is only strictly correct with
regard to Bhatta lands, lands either in the beds or close upon the banks
of rivers (in which may be included a few old river courses which,
though dry for the most part of the year, still have water flowing in
them in the monsoon freshes) where water is obtained, not from springs,
but from percolation.


{empty}3. Major Francis in his 8th paragraph points out a great practical
difficulty which would be frequently met with by the classer in noting
the fields to which the enhanced rate should be applied. How is he to
tell the depth of water from the surface, or its quality, in any field in
which there is no well to guide him ? He of course cannot dig
everywhere to ascertain, and it would be throwing too strong a temptation in
the way of a man drawing perhaps from 20 to 40 Rupees a month to
allow him to put down his surmises. Officers of higher rank above the
suspicion of yielding to temptation would simply throw up the attempt
in despair. I concur also with the Survey Commissioner's other remarks
in the same paragraph of his letter.  
  
  
  4. I beg to annex a copy of the Khandeish Superintendent's answer
<!-- Leaf 51, Page: 41 -->
which of the component multiple factors has the greater share in
bringing about the desired product. The one factor is equally
indispensable as the other, and each in its full force.


Sir George Wingate likens the case of a new well in the soil
to the opening of a new mine, which as long us the mineral
lies embedded in the earth has no value, but directly that
capital has enabled it to be brought to the surface, becomes valuable,
and the State receives benefit from it in the form of a royalty.
This analogy, however, does not, I think, strictly hold in the case
of water. True it is that water is a mineral product, as much
as iron, lead, silver, or coal. But there is a distinction between
water and any other mineral substance which seems to have
escaped notice, but which nevertheless enters as an important
element in determining its value. The distinction is this, that in
the first place, whereas such mineral substances as gold, silver,
iron, &c. are, economically considered, luxuries, water is a
necessary substance, necessary for the existence and comfort of
man; and, secondly, that while so necessary to the existence
of. man, it is abundantly supplied all over the earth by the
bountiful providence of God; that where it exists in abundant
quantities as in rivers, lakes, ponds, &c, it has no exchangeable
value, though it is so necessary to man's existence; and that
whatever value which has been imparted to it is chiefly owing to
the difficulty and labour involved in conveying it to a place where it
could, betaken advantage of. In this respect it differs
remarkably from the case of other mineral substances.


Thus it will be seen that that which determines the value of
water is the difficulty of rendering it accessible to men, at a
place where it is most needed, and in proportion as this
difficulty is great or small, is the value of water. The analogy of other
minerals does not hold in the case of water, in determining the
right of the State for a royalty. The greater the difficulty of
obtaining it, the stronger is the claim of those who have spent
capital and labour in procuring the facilities of its supply.


Accordingly, we find that Major Prescott, in view probably of
the considerations above presented, observes :—" Everybody
admits that the assessment of wells dug at the expense of private  
  
  
  6
<!-- Leaf 101, Page: 91 -->
tive improvement of land under the new settlement exempted it from
further taxation on that account, and secondly, that during the
continuance of this pledge nothing had been done by Government which
could show that it contributed in any way towards conferring an increased
value upon the soil.


To show that we are not setting up an imaginary grievance, that the
authorities fully competent to deal with such questions acknowledge the
injustice here complained of, we place before our readers the following
extract from an article entitled ' The Laud Assessments of India ' by a
writer in the third number (July 1855) of the late Bombay Quarterly
Review, who seems to be fully conversant with the subject. After
describing how fields are surveyed and boundary disputes settled,
the writer goes on to offer his views on the principle of
classification of lands :—

\"The extra cess for water is levied equally on land irrigated by wells, or from
bundarahs. We think this principle, however, both unjust and impolitic; in nineteen cases
out of twenty, the fields irrigated by wells have been cultivated by the same family
from a period long aotcrior to our rule; and the probability, nay, almost certainty,
is that the wells were made by the immediate ancestors of the present occupants; they
should, therefore, be considered in the liykt of private capital invested for the
improvement qj the land; and the interest of the capital so invested ought never to be absorbed or
encroached upon by Government. ***** We think it would be an admirable
expedient, both as regards liberality and justice, to forego it (extra cess on water).
The improvement of the country by the construction of new wells, and the
consequently increased prosperity of the people, would be tbe immediate result; the prospective
result would be the enhanced revenue that would accrue to Government, after the
expiration of the present term of 30 years. It is true that Government have
determined and have especially ordered, that no extra cess shall be levied from any well
that may be constructed subsequent to the introduction of the new settlement; but
to make the measure thoroughly effective, it should have a retrospective provision;
the certainty and stability of the advantage would then be brought more fully aud
practically before the people, and many a family would devote a surplus couple of
hundred rupees to the construction of a well instead of squandering it upon the puerile
and useless ceremonies of a marriage feast, with tbe concomitant and indecent
exhibition of a village nautch."


But the evil does not stop here. It is not simply the land into which
a well has been sunk that has an extra cess levied upon it. All the
adjacent lands are subjected to garden rates, whether the holders of
them derive the benefit of the neighbouring well, or not. Where they
do not, it is manifestly cruel to tax them. Where they do, it is by
paying to the owner of the well an additional charge in the shape oipiyawa,
or price for the use of water. The ryot has thus two parties to pay
to for the use of a single benefit, the Government and the owner
of the well.

  KAIRA : A DISTRICT IN FERTILE GUJARAT.

\"os the main ducts; to the nature of the country to the south
•'of the Taptee, which is traversed by several broad and deep
\"streams; and to the fact that much of the best land in the delta
\"is not British territory.


\"4th.—That with these drawbacks, a return of 8 per cent, on
'• the proposed outlay of 36f lakhs may confidently be
antici-- pated by means of a water-rate at 2 Rupees an acre on
-- the land irrigated, besides indirect profits and advantages.

col" lectorate since it has been a British possession, that
Govern" ment might well take in hand works which would greatly
\"benefit and enrich the district, even if they did not yield a
\"large remunerative return to the State."


And yet the project has been lying buried in the archives of
our Public Works Department, till some engineer, feeling an
interest in the work, may think it proper to call some day the
attention of Government thereto. The noble Nerbudda, the
largest of the rivers in Gujarat, can surely in some of its parts at
least be turned to use for irrigation purposes, and so in the case of
the Saburmutty. In the Kaira zilla, we have the Mahi, the
Watruck, the Meshwa, the Shehedhi, and the Mohur, which
enclose pretty large basins of fertile land. We admit that in
the case of some of the rivers, the difference between the actual
levels of their surface, and the surface of the surrounding land
is so great as hardly to admit of the land being watered; that in
others, as in Shehedhi, the river water is so bad as to be unfit
for irrigation, and would rather spoil the land than improve it.
But the natural resources of Gujarat in respect of water supply
are boundless, and it is worthy of an enlightened Government
to at least see that all possible means have been tried and found
wanting.


Captain Chambers was deputed to report upon all the rivers of
Gujarat. And nothing could be more important to those
interested in the irrigation of the Province, than to know what rivers
he visited, what he thought of the capabilities of each for
<!-- Leaf 116, Page: 106 -->
irrigain Western India, as it now does in some parts of upper India; when
each man and his cattle will cultivate 5 acres highly, instead of 20 on a
rougher system. Then the elasticity of the land revenue, in proportion to
the increased necessities of the Government of a large and wealthier
population, which you so strongly and justly eulogize, will be nowhere, if
you have cut off the power of taking as revenue a portion or the whole
(according to the land system) of the natural increase of rent flowing
from tbe development of the water wealth of the land.


I dissent from the opinion that land should be taxed according to its
capability of yielding water, whether it be used or not, such a rule is
applied to no other thing which is capable of use, and of yielding rent. As
well tax people for the use of grazing land because it might be cultivated,
or of cultivated land because you might build a valuable house on it.
The former will not be cultivated till the conditions of its neighbourhood
force it into cultivation; and the latter will not be built on till the site
becomes of value for house building, so the well will not be made till the
pressure of population on the land necessitates reduction of area and
higher tillage. Then all three will become fair subjects for a higher rent.
The essence of the matter lies in the fact that here the State has a virtual
monopoly of the land, and should be careful to impose no rent tax which
would not naturally result under a system of numerous separate
landlords, and capitalist farming. Under the latter conditions, the farmer
would sufficiently protect himself. As it is, the care of the State should
be to give ample time for the recovery of the capital invested in the
development of the water advantage, before imposing the rent tax which
it is its duty as well as right, to do on the natural superiority of the land
owing to its water wealth.

  NOTE ON LETTER No. I  
  
  
  TO THE EDITOR OF THE "TIMES OF INDIA."


Sir,—1. I am glad to find that Government has ordered the
publication of papers connected with the assesssment of the Kaira zilla.


{empty}2. My assertion that a water rate was never levied by former
Governments, or the present Government before the new survey came into
opreration, admits of no modification. The fact that " excepting in Nurwa
villages, the practice both of the foimer and present Government was to
levy a Jinuswari Bigotee (crop assessment)" shows most clearly that the
assessment of Nurwa villages was based upon considerations other than
those which influenced the settlement of lands held under other tenures.
In fact the very essence of the Nurwa tenure as it obtained under the
<!-- Leaf 109, Page: 99 -->
be allowed to enjoy its fruits only for 30 years, and that at the end
of that term it would revert to the State. We have deliberately
abandoned the principle which the warning embodied, and are
bound in doing so to give the reform retrospective effect. We have
abandoned the principle as impolitic; and having done so we cannot
as it seems to us coutinue to act upon it without creating a sense of
grievance in the people. If the principle of taxing improvements is
wrong, it was as wrong 30 years ago as now; and in
abandoning it, it is unworthy of an enlightened Stat6 to seek to retain
its profits up to the date of our conversion. Many years ago, as we
learn from the Native Opinion, this very question was raised in the
Bombay Quarterly Review (July 1855) in the following terms :—" In
\"nineteen cases out of twenty, the fields irrigated by wells have been
\"cultivated by the same family from a period long anterior to our
\"rule; and the probability, nay almost certainty, is that the wells
\"were made by the immediate ancestors of the present occupants;
\"they should therefore be considered in the light of private capital
invest" ed for the improvement of the land; and the interest of the capital so
\"invested ought never to be absorbed or encroached upon by Government.
We think it would be an admirable expedient, both as
re" gards liberality and justice, to forego it (extra cess on water). The
\"improvement of the country by the construction of new wells, and the
\"consequently increased prosperity of tbe people, would be the
imme" diate result; the prospective result would be the enhanced revenue that
\"would accrue to Government, after the expiration of the present term
\"of 30 years. It is true that Government have determined aud have
\"especially ordered that no extra cess shall be levied from any wells

\"people, and many a family would devote a surplus couple of hundred
\"rupees to the construction of a well instead of squandering it upon the
\"puerile and useless ceremonies of a marriage feast, with the
concomi" tant and indecent exhibition of a village nautch."


We do not think that it is possible to make any reply to this
statement, or to maintain the justice of what we are doing. The case is
perhaps one of those in which compromise is the true art of Government.
The ryot, in the circumstauces described, should be perhaps assessed at
the maximum dry crop rate, or allowed to buy up the reversionary
interest of the State in his well, at a very few years' purchase : say five to
seven years. As to assessing his neighbour's lands at garden rates, it
is so monstrous that we find if impossible to believe it to be the
factWhat has the Acting Collector of Kaira to say about it ?
<!-- Leaf 97, Page: 87 -->
ing Collector of Kaira as my instructor in revenue matters, pretend as
he may to a considerable knowledge of them, for, instead of a tissue of
indignant statements hardly warranted by the nature of the question, I
certainly had expected something better from him. I will now proceed
to notice some of his statements


In the second para, of his letter, Mr. Elliot enunciates a fundamental
principle in regard to the land of this country, namely that ' all land is
or was once Imperial property,' and connects it with ' objectors to the
Bill for City Surveys now before the Legislative Council.' Now, if you
will kindly refer to my letter published in your issue of the 22nd instant,
you will find that I have nowhere called in question this principle.
Neither was it my object to do so.


Nor have I made the remotest allusion to the City Surveys Bill either
in the way of objecting or supporting it. I have my own opinion of the
Bill, but this had had nothing to do with the point under discussion in
the letter.


Mr. Elliot next goes on to apply this dictum of land to Act I. of
1865, but this, I think, he does to little or no purpose. I never
disapproved of the'principle which guides the revenue survey, nor have I
anywhere called the land assessment of this talooka as being particularly
heavy. On the contrary, what I said was—" I admit that the Bombay
Revenue Settlement possesses many meritso f its own. But it is fair
that, in a prominent recognition of this fact the defects of the settlement
and the injustice which it sometimes has been the means of inflicting
upon ryots, should not be passed over in silence." I simply thought
when I wrote the letter, that the injustice of which I had complained
had only to be brought to the notice of Government or its
superior revenue officers, to be properly remedied.


The fact is that while conversing and discussing the question of the
recent land settlement of the Neriad talooka with some intelligent
Patidars or Nurwadars, and ryots of the town, I found that a heavy water-rate
on account of well-irrigation, entered as an important element of the
settlement. This item, it must be remembered, was never levied either
by the present Government, before the new settlement came into
operation, or by the previous Government. Now, you will admit that sinking
a well into a land is adding to its improvement. And, if a heavy rate on
account of well-irrigation formed au item of land assessment, it could be
looked aft in no other light than as a tax ou improvements, even though
the present total assessment of the talooka might not be greater than the
past, whereas the boast of the Bombay Revenue Settlement has all along
been not to tax improvements.


To meet this complaint, it was surely not required on the part of the
Collector to give ' a very sketchy precis of the voluminous correspondence
in which officers, thoroughly familiar with the duty they had to do,
<!-- Leaf 43, Page: 33 -->
disdeparture from the original and essential principle of the
settlement in levying, over and above the Jeerayat or dry-crop rates,
a separate and extra cess on wells which are the private property
of the ryots, and with constructing or repairing which the State
has had nothing whatever to do. That this is an illiberal policy,
unworthy of a wise, beneficent, and enlightened Government,
who profess to afford every encouragement to the development
of agricultural industry, and thereby to promote the true
national wealth of the country, is even admitted by Government,
as is manifest from the policy adopted in exempting old wells
in certain parts of the Dekkan. The question naturally arises,
Why not exempt all old wells, thereby applying one
universal rule to improvements effected in land ? Owners of old wells
have as equal a right to exemption as those of new wells, or,
perhaps, greater, from the fact of their having laid out capital in
improvements at a period when capital was very scarce in the
country, and also, in some cases, under a full assurance of
exemption from future rates.


It has been urged, in the third proposition, that owners of old
wells have already reaped the fruits of their improvements in the
exemption they enjoyed up to the period of the revised
settlement. But should this be held forth as a pretext for taxing them
on the introduction of the revised settlement ? Should it not, on
the contrary, give them a prescriptive right to exemption
hereafter ? Having hitherto enjoyed freedom from any
imposition on their wells, they are the more entitled to a continuance of
that exemption than others. In not having exempted them from
the levy of a cess which, at best, is precarious, Government has
laid itself open to a charge of wrong doing, which it is bound in
the true interests of right and justice as well as of the happiness
of the commonwealth to redress.


To maintain, then, as is done in the fourth proposition, that if
any wrong is done in the levy of this charge on old wells, the
British Government is not bound to redress it, is clearly opposed
to reason as well as to fact. Supposing, for a moment, (what
really is not the case as shown above) that wrong was done by
native rulers in making a charge on irrigated lands, it surely

of every available piece. It is remarkable, however, that while
side by side with this thickly-peopled district, there lies what
may be termed almost a desert waste forming the territory of the
Punch Mahals—where population is so sparse—there is hardly
any attempt made at emigration. So fondly have the cultivators
of this zilla clung to their soil, that they would rather endure all
the consequences resulting from a keen competition for land in
their own village than remove to the neighbouring territory.
There is no doubt that if some of the superabundant population
of this zilla could be induced to emigrate to and settle in Punch
Mahals, they would be greatly assisting the hitherto neglected
resources of that part of the country; since as a cultivator, and,
in some respects, a scientific one too, it must be admitted the
fame of the Churotur Koonbi stands unrivalled in Gujarat. High
farming in the Kaira district, as also the richness of the soil, is
due more to the skill of the agriculturist than to any natural
advantages of situation or climate. Like a busy bee, the Churotur
Koonbi works from ' earhr morn to dewy eve' in his field,
tending his plants, and looking after his crops and his cattle. His
field is hedge-bound. Wherever there are facilities for irrigation
he raises crops at all seasons of the year—wet, dry, and garden.
His mode of living is most economical. His wife exercises tho
functions of a real ' help-mate' to him. As soon as the Kunbi
rises from his bed, he cleanses his mouth, eats a morsel of bread
with meerchi or chutni—of which he is immoderately fond—takes
his plough and his bullocks, and starts on his way to his field.
His wife, wlio looks after his household affairs and children,
prepares the noonday meal, and having supplied breakfast to the
children, places in a basket all that is intended for the husband,
and proceeds to the field with the basket on her head. On
arriving there, she empties the basket of its contents, and spreads them
before her lord, who, with a keen appetite after the labours of the
morning, heartily enjoys the simple repast. His drink is as
simple as his food, consisting only of pure water. It is only lately
that his brother—the kooli cultivator—has come to indulge a little
in ardent spirits. But, upon the whole, the Gujarat cultivator is
as simple in his habits as he is thrifty in the use of his means.
<!-- Leaf 77, Page: 67 -->
water capabilities having been previously carefully determined. For
example:—Suppose the maximum jerayut rate of a village to be Rs. 5.
and that according to the scale (framed from the data given above) 6
pies in the Rupee had been fixed as the water value, then I would make
the maximum rate Rs. 5-2 instead of Rs. 5, throwing out the 6 pies for
facility of calculation.


{empty}9. The assessment of a jerayut field of 4 acres classed at say 11 annasi
would at the former rate be Rs. 13 12 and at the latter Rs. 14, a difference
really inappreciable to a Gujarat cultivator. I feel perfectly certain that
if the people themselves had the deciding of the question, they would
very gladly pay this slight increase on all jerayut lands, if by doing so
they could get rid of well assessment present and prospective.  
  
  
  10. I am well aware of the fact pointed out in paragraph 2 of your

  my opinion that tbe phenomenon is confined

to certain tracts which can be defined by careful observation and
classification.


If even one brackish or salt well should be found in a village, I
would degrade that village on the theory that the whole of the wells
are liable to turn brackish or salt.


11. I am of opinion that the shock of an earthquake would be very
likely to cause sulphureous or nitrous springs to break into any, or all
the wells of villages, in which the soil is known to be impregnated with
these ingredients as indicated by ita presence in certain wells, but I feel
confident that no such change would take place in those tracts where the
water, in all the wells—without any exception—is found to be free from
any sulphureous or nitreous taint.


12. The whole system of assessing bhatta and natural bagayut lands
—which are as different as it is possible for anything to be, from
jerayut-bagayut,—has been so fully explained by Mr. Pedder, that I need
say no more on the subject.


13. With regard to the subject under consideration Mr. Pedder
writes as follows :—


\"I have the honour to reply to your Memo. No. 301a of 1865 upon the
subject of the assessment of garden lands.


\"2. I will first consider briefly the mode of bagayut assessment
which we have adopted in this Survey, with especial reference to
Major Francis' strictures upon it, and will then proceed to offer a few
remarks upon the system which Mr. Ellis proposed to substitute for it.
<!-- Leaf 119, Page: 109 -->
sessment for five years (not 30, which the Neriad people have enjoyed) to
a ryot who makes a well, is thought liberal in the Gaekwar's country.


I must notice another misrepresentation. Native Opinion states that
the survey officers attempted to induce, or force the Nurwadars to break
their tenure. No such attempt was ever made, nor was there any
reason why it should have been made, since, as I have stated before, the
tenure conveys no exemptions from assessment, and Government receives
precisely the same revenue from a village, whether it is held on the
nurwa or on the ordinary survey tenure. The people were merely asked,
before the papers were prepared for the settlement, whether they would
elect the nurwa or the survey tenure, which they have a right to do
though Government has not. I am sorry to see that reckless
mis-statements of the objects and effects of Government measures are becoming
rather the rule than the exception in the Native Press.

<!-- Leaf 115, Page: 105 -->
well of 12 or 15 feet depth, such as is made in every field in many parts
of the N. W. Provinces, and costing but 30 or 40 rupees even when made
by hired labour, suffices to irrigate the land with a small expenditure of
man and bullock power in raising the water. In other parts the water is
deeper below the surface, the soil is not so firm as to stand without
masonry lining, and severe labour is necessary in raising it. Surely these
different conditions point to an essential difference in the value of
the two plots, such a difference in fact as constitutes a rent value in favor
of the former. The kernel of the matter lies in the rule, that no water
rates should be levied till the capital invested has been returned to the
well sinker, over and above the profits due to its investment and to the
labour expended in raising the water; and that when levied they should
not absorb any of the profit due to the continued labour of raising the
water. In most cases the capital will have been returned, with its just
profits long before the expiry of a 30 years' settlement. In the case of a
\"kucha" well 15 feet deep the capital is returned within 4 or 5 years at
the outside. I will not trouble you with figures to prove this at present,
though it would be easy to do so.


So much for the justice of levying judiciously water rates on irrigation
from wells; and now for its policy. It may be true, though I incline to
doubt it, that a resolution to abandon for ever all increase of revenue
from this source may tend to encourage the sinking of wells more than
leases at fixed rates for terms of 30 years. But this is not the only
point to be looked to. Sinking a well, and irrigating land, is only one
of many methods of applying a higher tillage to the soil; of getting a
heavier crop with the same labour and capital from a smaller area. The
ryot with a single plough cultivates 20 or 25 acres of dry crop land, and
pays say 20 or 25 rupees rent. If he sinks a well, and devotes the labour
of himself and cattle to irrigations can manage only a much smaller area,
4 or 5 acres. If therefore he chooses to resort to this system of
cultivation, and no water rates are levied, he will get off with 5 per cent rent,
and the land tax (where the State takes the whole rent) will be reduced
by Ra. 20 or Rs. 25. These are round figures, and cannot be exact under
varying conditions of circumstances and agricultural system. But they
approximate to a case by no means uncommon in Western India, and of
which hundreds may be investigated in my own district. I do not say
that, if water rates are knocked off, this system of higher tillage will be
invariably resorted to. In fact, it will not, so long as there is no
pressure of population on the land, for rough cultivation over a large area is
admitted to be (as can also be easily shown in figures) more profitable
than higher cultivation of a smaller area. But before passing laws such
as this, which limit future action under changed conditions, the coming
time should be looked forward to when population will press on the land  
  
  
  U
<!-- Leaf 114, Page: 104 -->

I begin conclusion to make two observations. Native Opinion suggests
that the survey settlements are unjust, because sometimes the new rates
exceed the old ones. In this very case of Neriad, the prices of
agricultural produce have at least trebled sine the oid rate was fixed; and at a
vast expense to the State, the railway has been brought to the very gates
of the town. If then the old rates were fair, they should at least have
been trebled by the survey, whereas the increase is, I believe, about 10
per cent.


My other remark is this : when the landlord is the State, the native
press is ever ready to uphold, perhaps? to exaggerate, the right of the
tenant. But when the landlord is a private person, a khote, for instance,
the slightest attempt on the part of Government to protect the tenant,
to defend his hereditary iuterest in the soil, or to guard the returns to his
capital invested in it, is represented as an interference with the rights of
property and a gross injustice to the landlord. Does not this look a little
as if the object of the writers was not so much to uphold sound
economical principles or to benefit the agricultural classes, as to vilify
Government ? A. B.

  TO THE EDITOR OF THE "TIMES OF INDIA."


Sir,—Allow me to make a few remarks with reference to your leading
article of November 20th, and the correspondence reproduced in the same
issue, on the subject of levying water rates ou land irrigated from wells.


As settlement officer of a district virtually interested in the development
of this species of land improvement, I have very carefully considered
this question; and have been led to the conclusion that the imposition,
on a proper system, of higher rates on land so irrigated is not only wholly
free from the imputation of taxing capital,' but also essential to the
maintenance of a just incidence of the land tax in accordance with the
natural rent value of the land. Your quotation from Sir G. Wingate's
note on the subject, in connection with the revised assessment of the
Indapore talook, exactly expresses the view I hold regarding the j ustness of
this measure. The capability of land to yield water, by sinking wells
at a greater or less depth is as much a natural advantage, as is its
superiority of soil or situation, or any other quality that gives value to one
piece of land over another, and constitutes its natural rent. Take the
common case of a piece of land commanded by a running stream which
only requires the construction of a simple bund, at the trifling cost of
a few stones and a puddling of mud, to turn its water on to the land.
Would you hold that land so irrigated should pay no higher rent,
because its possessor (subject to land tax) has invested a morning's work, or
a few rupees of " capital," in realizing his advantage ? So with the
water bearing stratum below the surface. In some places a " Kutcha"
<!-- Leaf 47, Page: 37 -->
should be in the same proportion. I have never been able to
understand the force of this argument or to recognize the right
which the State claims to a higher assessment on lands irrigated
by wells constructed out of the hard-earned savings of the
cultivators, and with the liberal provisions of Section XXX. of the
Survey Act patent to all, I see immense difficulty in convincing
the ryots of the justness of our present claim on their wells.
Why, Sir, have we such difficulty in making the incident of the
well assessment equitable—whether we put it on the bag, the
well, or the soil ? Simply, I submit, because we cannot make
right in practice ivhat is wrong in principle, t I foresee that if any
great calamity should overwhelm this province—draught or
famine for example—our mode of taxing private capital expended
in sinking would be condemned by all sound economists. Colonel
Baird Smith was of opinion (Report para. 101) that to keep an
agricultural population above want, under all vicissitudes,
onethird at least of the cultivated land should be provided with the
means of irrigation. Now, what is the present position of
Neriad, in this respect the most highly irrigated talooka in the
province? Of a cultivated area of 128,219 acres, 11,930 only,
or a little over 9 per cent (Government and alienated exclusive)
is irrigated. Less than one-tenth of the whole available area.
We draw all we can out of Gujarat, do not expend one shilling in
works of irrigation, and tax wells besides. I cannot think this
is the way to be forearmed for the evil hour, which may come
when we least expect it. I am well aware we cannot abandon
this source of revenue at one fell stroke, but it is clear we must
do it 30 years hence—when as no new wells will be taxed, we
cannot possibly levy a Kussur on the old. I hope, therefore,
that notwithstanding the heavy profits which I am well aware
accrue to all well-owners in Neriad and Borsud, we may be
induced to look on this source of revenue as condemned to
abandonment after 30 years, and prepare ourselves for it by imposing a
moderate Kussur on principle. It we do not, the Kussur will
abandon us, for cultivators will take care never to repair old
wells, or to prevent them falling to decay, well knowing that if

<!-- Leaf 57, Page: 47 -->
too low, and decided upon raising them \, which was
immediately done by adding 8 annas to every rupee of Kussur in the
Register.


Such is Major Prescott's scheme of " Bagayut Kussur," or
assessment on irrigated lands. The objections to it are :—


First, The difficulty of working out the scheme in all its integrity.
This difficulty arises chiefly from the fact that the water springs
of wells in Gujarat do not invariably give out the same quality
of water. It is a well known fact in Gujarat that such
phenomenon as earthquake, or any natural cause has the effect of
turning a sweet water spring into one of brackish or salt water.
Many a well is rendered valueless to the owner on account of
this circumstance. Major Prescott evidently is not ignorant
of this fact.


\"For some time," says he, " all goes on smoothly. Suddenly either
from the 6hock of an earthquake or from some other unknown cause, a
few wells or a great many wells (in one village or general villages of
the district which have hitherto been sweet and have been assessed as
such) turn brackish or salt. Now (as you are well aware) there are several
grades of brackish water which are defined as brackish, brackish drinkable,
brackish undriukable, and salt. As soon as the Collector receives the
petitions he must either remit the kussur, on their well in ' toto,'or make a
reference to the Survey Department to know how brackish the water has
become, and how much the kussur is to be lowered in consequence, or to
say the least of it, he must send some trustworthy person to examine the
wells, and see whether they have become really salt or not."


Another source of the difficulty lies in the fact that in the
sandy soil of Gujarat, wells fall in every year unless they are
originally of strong masonry construction or annually kept in
repairs. With every fall of wells, the kussur has to be remitted.
The well assessment is thus of a most precarious character, the
amount being liable to sink every year until it dwindles into an
insignificant sum.


Secondly, The principle upon which the Kussur is determined
is of an arbitrary character and open to the charge of unfairness.
The determination of the rates of kussur on well-land is a most
difficult task. That the land under a certain sweet water well
should be charged a particular rate, say Rs. 5 per acre, and
another under a well of which the water differs slightly in quality
from its neighbour, should be charged another rate, depends
<!-- Leaf 48, Page: 38 -->
they sink new ones in the place of repairing old, they will be free
of taxation for ali time."


What Major Prescott says above is taking place exactly just
now in Gujarat, at least in the Kaira zilla. Old wells sunk in
Nurwa lands being subjected to a heavy cess, their owners leave
them to fall off rather than put themselves to the expense of
repairing them, and yet pay the water cess.


To remedy the hardship occasioned by the levy of the water
cess, and to get rid of ' disputes, inquiries, and correspondence
which are continually arising out of the troublesome subject of
well assessment,' Mr. W. G. Pedder, then Survey Settlement
Officer in Gujarat, proposed to Government a plan for
commuting the cess at 15 years' purchase, that is to say, the
Government was to forego the right of levying the cess on the
cultivators agreeing to pay, in one or two instalments, 15 times the annual
amount now payable by them. The plan, however, is based upon
the supposition that the Government has the right to levy the cess.
But the supposition is absurd. No right of Government to levy the
cess can be made out,—especially in the case of those permanent
masonry wells which have been constructed by the cultivators
out of their own savings. It is quite manifest that the owners of
these wells are perfectly entitled to the free and unfettered use
of the profits of the property they have been the means of
creating. The proposal to allow them the right of redeeming the
cess once for all by paying 15 times the amount appears
monstrous when it is considered that it is the duty of Government
to encourage rather than check irrigation; and that the most
crying want of Gujarat is an abundant supply of water for
agricultural purposes. It is not at all to be wondered at that the
Nurwadars of the Kaira zilla, and, in fact, the ryots of Gujarat
in general, should at once decline to acquiesce in a proposal
of this kind. The question, however, has thus remained at a
stand-still. Irrigation has thus received a check in Gujarat which
nothing but the enunciation of a liberal policy will overcome.


In handing this proposal of Mr. Pedder's to Government,
Major C. J. Prescott, then Superintendent, Gujarat Revenue
Survey, after expressing his fear that the amount thus obtained
<!-- Leaf 91, Page: 81 -->
No. 15, that the Ryots of the districts of Kaira and Ahmedabad declined
the offer made them to commute the extra assessment on garden lands
watered by wells.


{empty}2. Whilst I regret to learn the failure of this plan of Mr. Pedder, I
quite approve the remark in your Resolution as to the necessity of
seeking for some other sources whence the funds for these important
drainage works can be drawn.

under the old rule neither the extent and quantity of dry-crop
and irrigated lands nor the value of their produce entered as
principal elements in determining the amount of the lump
assessment. There were no garden rates fixed on lands watered by
wells, no charge on account of natural facilities for water, far less
for artificial ones. As long as the Nurwadar was prepared to
pay his phalani, or quota of assessment, he remained
unmolested. The Kulum bundees, or agreements passed under the
native rule by the village community of those days, may be
confidently appealed to for testimony on this subject. These
agreements, signed by the Mutadars of Nurwadari villages, simply
mentioned the amount of the lump assessment for which they held
themselves answerable; the instalments by which they were
payable, and the mode or modes by which due payment was
guaranteed to the Sirkar in case of non-fulfilment of
engagements. Not the remotest allusion was made in them of garden
rates leviable on irrigated lands. The village lands being divided
into paties, the headman of each pati had to answer for due
payment of amounts by individual Nurwadars comprised in his
section.


The plea, therefore, set forth in the second proposition, that
in levying rates on old wells the British Government has simply
followed the practice of the native rulers, is founded upon a
misconception of the essential characteristics of the Nurwa
tenure. The native government was in fact too lazy to go into
all the minute particulars regarding the state of every field and
the condition of every cultivator. It was simply with a view to
avoid close and searching enquiries into these
matters—enquiries distasteful alike to the Government as well as to the
peasantry—that the Nurwa system found general favor. It
had also another attraction in the social importance it gave to the
leading men of tho village community of Gujarat—an
importance prized above all other considerations, and even at the
sacrifice sometimes of considerable sums of money.

The British Government, therefore, while openly professing
to continue the Nurwa system, in the form in which it has hitherto
been found to exist in the country, is clearly responsible for a
<!-- Leaf 105, Page: 95 -->
in this talooka, as in other parts of Gujarat, tho Kunbi and the Koli.
The difference in their characteristic energies marks the results of their
cultivation. The Churotur Kunbi is famed for his agricultural skill, for
the proper use of his implements, aud for tbe breed of his cattle. His
unwearied industry in looking after his soil, in collecting and preserving
manure, the dogged perseverance, so to speak, with which he watches,
by day and by night, the growth of his crops,—watering them often in
the heat of the sun—are only equalled by the abundance of the most
valuable crops he has been instrumental in producing. The Koli
cultivator, on the other hand,—though, perhaps, equally able-bodied as the
Kunbi—has neither the patience, nor the firmness to go through all the
toil and trouble, which tax the best energies of his brother
cultivator. He trusts to the natural fall of rain. He never digs a
well. Perhaps, when willing, he is unable to command means to
do it. He hardly saves. The crop he raises barely suffices to last him
through the season. The consequence is that the majority of Koli
villages are poor; whereas the KuDbi villages are rich and flourishing.
The seven Patees into which the town of Neriad is divided, for the
purposes of revenue administration, are a notable instance of this.
They are all held under the Narwadari tenure, and are the only lands
in the talooka which pay the highest assessment to Government. Now,
there are about 125 wells sunk in these Patees, and the average cost of
each well is about Rs. 2,000. This is no exaggerated amount, when it
is borne in mind that wells in some parts of the Kaira Collectorate are
very deep, water not being accessible under 70, or 80, and, sometimes,
100 feet below the Burface of the soil. The Narwadars of Neriad have
expended nearly two and a half lakhs of Rupees in their well-property.
Hence it may naturally be supposed that they are fully entitled to the
interest of their investment. But no. Our wise men of the survey
would not allow them the undisturbed enjoyment of the fruits of their
capital and labour. The maximum Bagayat Kussur said to be of Re. 7J
per acre is levied upon them. And thus, while the most industrious
cultivators bear the burden of the cess, the less active escape from it.
The cess might be conceived in the light of a tax on instruments of
increased production, similar in kind, though not in degree, to a tax on
plough, or bullocks which, at one time, prevailed under native rule.
But though the maximum Bagayat rate ie Rs. 7£ per acre, the actual
rate charged is more. Tbe Survey Department has ascertained that the
irrigable land of this talooka is 7,614 acres, and the total amount of
the Kussur upon Government and Alienated lands is Rs. 39,011-4-0,
which gives an average water rate of Rs. 5-2-0 per acre. But a most
palpable error in this calculation arises from the confusion of irrigable
with irrigated lands. The actually irrigated, or garden (bagayet) lands
are 3,705 acres, as the records of the Survey would show, and it is this
<!-- Leaf 13, Page: 3 -->
the Settlement Officers to merge the peculiarities of tenure into
a general ryotwari system on thirty years' lease. Yet so marked
and anciently recognised have been the features of tenures in
certain talookas of this zilla, that a wide departure from the
usual procedure was considered necessary. These tenures,
known as nurwadari or bhagdari tenures, had a legal recognition,
and their important features were noticed as far back as the
commencement of British rule in Gujarat. In a minute, dated
6th April 1821, written after a personal inspection of the country,
and with the aid of personal enquiries from the village patels,
Mountstuart Elphinstone described their main features which
were embodied in Section VIII. of Regulation XVII. of 1827.


To introduce the revised settlement, without altering the main
character of the existing tenures, was by no means an easy
matter. Accordingly, Government thought proper to depute
Mr. Pedder, of tho Revenue Survey, to specially enquire into
the Nurwadari tenure of Gujarat wherever it existed, and to
report upon the best mode of settling it consistently with the
principles of the New Survey. Mr. Pedder applied himself with
singular diligence to this enquiry, the result of which has been
embodied in an elaborate report, dated 21st March 1862, giving
a concise history of the tenure and the principles upon which it
should be settled. In the settlement of the entire zilla, however,
we must not omit to mention the names of Mr.
Shambhuprasad; Colonel Prescott, then Superintendent Revenue
Survey, Gujarat; the Hon'ble Mr. B. H. Ellis; and Mr. A.
Rogers, the present Revenue Commissioner, N. D. We can only
afford to place before the public the most prominent features of
this somewhat difficult settlement, and to discuss some
important questions connected therewith, leaving the reader to seek
for detailed information in the interesting reports in the volume
before us.


The Collectorate of Kaira comprises an area of 1,869 square
miles. The river Mhye forms its southern and eastern
boundary,—in fact, it separates the zilla from the new junior
collectorate of Broach on the south, and the Punch Mahals and the
State of Balasinore on the east. On the western side lies

the tenor of this that Mr. Davidson contemplates no other way of acting
up to the proposed system but that of going through the whole of the
processes preliminary to the imposition of a well assessment under the
existing system, and then putting that assessment on the lands under
the wells.

that no general order for carrying into effect the proposed system in
Gujarat and Khandeish be issued until the result of the experiment
which Captain Prescott has been directed to make iu the districts of

Sir,—In reply to your letter No. 955 dated 23rd March, 1865, I have
tbe honour to state, that for the lands irrigated from wells in Jamnair
and Sooltanpoor the extra cess can still be placed on the lands, only it
may be questionable, whether or not, the alteration if now made would
be quite judicious. The settlement papers have already gone into the
district and the people are aware of the amount they will have to pay
for the lauds including the bagayut rate, and it would be easily apparent
<!-- Leaf 21, Page: 11 -->
extraordinary prices during the cotton mania. But though it
has thus proved beneficial, the bhagbuttai system is not without
its disadvantages. The justice of levying one-third or one-half
the share of the cultivator's produce by the State may, perhaps,
be questioned, but apart from that consideration, it led to many
abuses. The temptation on the part of the cultivator to show
less than the actual outturn of his field, being too strong on the
one hand, and the native officials charged with looking to the
interests of the State being, on the other, generally corrupt, a
return of the full amount of the recognized share of
government was seldom possible. Even where it was possible,
government had to appear in the capacity of a seller of produce
or to commute it into its money value. This was, perhaps,
good so far as the article of produce was cotton, of which
the price was regulated by foreign demand, but in the
case of other articles, such as grains, consumed either in the
same or neighbouring territory, they often became a drug in the
market, having to compete with the cultivator's share of the
same produce.


To avoid many of these difficulties, the bhagbuttai system was
supplanted by what is called the kultur system, which consisted
in an estimate of the produce while the crop was standing in the
field, and the payment in money value of the government share
based upon this estimate. For this purpose a class of men,
called Ajmaesdars or appraisers, were appointed, whose duty it
was to estimate the amount and value of the crop, and to
declare the sum of money payable to Government. The kultur
system, which principally obtained in Broach and Kaira, was
found open to the same objections as the bhagbuttai, tho
Ajmaesdars being discovered to be hardly free from corruption, or
partiality.


In the time of the Mogul Empire, Todar Mull—the wise
Minister of Akbar,—considering that, upon the whole, the
interests of the State would be best served by a system of fixed
money payments, hit upon the plan which, in some respects, has
been the basis of our revenue survey. He ordered a survey to
be held of the lands of every village, fixing their boundaries,

No. 1049 of 1865.
To Captain C. J. PRESCOTT,
Superintendent Revenue Survey and Assessment, Gujarat.
Camp Bassein, 30th March 1865.


Sir,—In reply to your No. 548 of the 1st December, forwarding a
report from Mr. Pedder, recommending certain modifications in the well
assessment of Muhoonda, I have the honour to state that Mr. Pedder's
report has been submitted to Government for favourable consideration.


{empty}2. On the general question of well assessment I have submitted to
Government a separate report, copy of which is sent herewith for your
information. As already decided you will introduce the new system in
settling Bardolee and Chicklee this year, and you will report the result.


{empty}3. With regard to your proposed grouping for water, I think the
imposition of the rate should be limited to 50 feet of depth. Your 3rd
<!-- Leaf 54, Page: 44 -->
ciples of the Survey that if the inherent qualities of the soil be
such that water is produced by digging for it within a few feet
of the surface, this capability should be taxed as well as other
elements of fertility." He then suggests that the whole of the
revenue derived from wells might be made good by a slight
increase in the assessment of lands where water is so easily
procurable. " There is land," says he, " as in Sowda in Khandeish,
from which water may be obtained, but only by digging to the
depth of 80 to 90 feet. Such land should not be considered as
having a natural water capacity, and the owner should be free
to enjoy, untaxed, the results of his labour, and expenditure of
capital in raising water."


A scheme is accordingly prepared in consultation with Major
Prescott, to ascertain this " natural water capacity" of lands of
every village. In the first place, every village is grouped
according to the advantage it enjoys in respect of markets, roads,
climate, &c. Having done this it is placed under any of the
three groups into which the different descriptions of water are
classed. These classes are as under* :—  
  
  
  Sweet. Brackish. Salt.

Under 20 ft., 1st class. Under 20 ft., 2nd class. Under 20 ft., 3rd class.
Do. 30 ft., 2nd do. Do. 30 ft., 3rd do. Do. 30 ft., 4th do.
Over 30 ft., 3rd do. Over 30 ft., 4th do. Over 30 ft., 5th do.


Each of these classes would have an anna value, which value
would be incorporated in the dry-crop rate.


A scheme of this kind, though it has all the appearance
of fairness upon it on paper, is practically open to very
grave objections. It proceeds on the assumption that the
water-bearing stratum and the quality of water run very even
in Gujarat. Now, nothing can be further from the fact than
this assumption, as those who are acquainted with Gujarat
can well testify. Even the Settlement Officers of Government
may be appealed to to show that it is not true. And on this
point there can perhaps be no better testimony than that of
Mr. Rogers, the present able Revenue Commissioner, N. D.—a
gentleman than whom perhaps there is hardly any person in

to them that the extra cess on account of wells had been placed on the
lands, but if this is not considered of any great account, the change
would effect a great saving of time and simplification in the returns
from the Mamlutdars.


{empty}2. I shall be very happy to alter the papers, if on further
consideration it is still thought advisable to do so. All that there would be to
do is to have the additional cess on account of the wells incorporated
in the rate on the field.
I have the honour, &c.

From Captain C. J. PRESCOTT,

Superintendent Revenue Survey and Assessment, Gujarat,
To A. ROGERS, Esq.,
Revenue Commissioner N. D.
Surat, 2ith June 1864.


Sir,—I have the honour of acknowledging the receipt of your
Memorandum No. 1562 of the 15th ultimo and accompaniments.


{empty}2. You will perceive on a reference to my letter to your predecessor
No. 141 of the 4th of April last, that I reported my inability to carry out
ia Bardolee and Chicklee the principle advocated by Mr. Ellis. The

principle adopted in those talookas has been
remN°' "A <iated-he 8th cwc' fully described in the letter* from Mr.
Pedder, embodied in this communication, and the
details will be given in my Jummabundy Report as requested in your
Memorandum under reply.


{empty}3. As the new principle of assessment advocated by the Honourable
Mr. Ellis originated with me, I think it necessary to offer a few remarks

in explanation of the subject matter of my
ceLbe0; i864.dated the Ut °' °e' ]etteT* Ending up Mr. Pedder's proposalrecommending that the extra assessment in the

shape of " kussur" on garden lands, watered by pucka wells in
Ahmedabad and Kaira should be commuted by offering the occupants a
remission of their well assessment in consideration of a payment—once for
all—of a certain number of years' purchase of the annual water rate.


{empty}4. When I handed up Mr. Pedder's letter it struck me that the
principle—having for its object the redemption of a certain portion of the
Imperial annual revenue the amount of which was to be applied to local
purposes—would not be sanctioned, but agreed entirely with that
gentleman as to the very precarious nature of this kind of assessment,
and felt as anxious as he did to get rid of it altogether, provided  
  
  
  9
<!-- Leaf 83, Page: 73 -->
Now there are several objections to this method.  
  
  
  1st.—It is very laborious. In a district like Duskrohi, containing

about 4.000 wells, which irrigate 20,000 or 25,000 different fields,

it takes the settling officer 5 or 6 hours' work a day for 2 or 3

months, and the duty cannot well be entrusted to karkoons as

so many difficulties continually present themselves.  
  
  
  2nd.—Until the settling officer hae fixed for each village what
num
bers or portions of numbers are to be entered as bagayut in

columns 8 and 9 of the above table, tbe Registers caunnot be

begun to be calculated, and this throws the settlement very

late in the season.  
  
  
  3rd.—If, as often must happen, an error is made in the fields under

the well, in the shares, in the capacity of the well, &c, correction

requires the recalculation of the acres and rates of both the

bagayut and dry-crop land under the well, which takes time

and trouble.  
  
  
  4th.—If after the settlement a well falls in the Collector cannot

remit the garden assessment upon the lands irrigated from it

without recalculating the dry-crop assessment from the
classi
fication annas.


\"20. To avoid these inconveniences, we adopted the bagayut kussur
system, and I must observe, that Major Francis has been misinformed
that the garden assessment in Gujarat is fixed upon ' the water-bag.'
It is fixed upon the land, but it is distinct from, and in addition to, the
dry-crop assessment.


\"21. In the example given above (para. 19) the dry-crop rate being
Rs. 3 and the garden rate Rs. 8, the total bagayut assessment, exclusive
of the dry-crop assessment, upon 8 acres, would be Rs. 40. The entries
would then be made thus :—

\"22. It must not be supposed that in order to arrive at the amount

footnote:[Possible signature: "10"]
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P83_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 102, Page: 92 -->

It is idle to say that this has been done with a view to equalize
assessments all round; that the total assessment rates fixed by the new
survey are not heavy, compared with the rates of the settlement it has
superseded, and that the ryot is, upon the whole, on a far better footing
by the new settlement. Granting all this, for argument (for in many
places as we hope to show some day the rate is heavier than ever it was
before) we object to the principle of a water cess as being manifestly
unjust and inexpedient, especially as the facility of water is the result
of tbe ryot's investment of capital and not at all of Government making.
It has been suggested that the Neriad Patidars, and others similarly
situated, should redeem the extra assessment by a fifteen years' purchase.
Such a suggestion carries absurdity on the very face of it. Is it tho
ryot that is to enjoy the interest upon the outlay of the capital invested
by him in his well, or is the Government, who has done nothing in the
matter, to encroach upon it ?


When it is considered that the most crying want of Gujarat is
irrigation, and that by encouraging well-irrigation, Government is in a
position to avert the dire effects of a calamity such as is now devastating
Marwar, it seems not a little surprising how such narrow views as those
which allow an extra cess on water obtain predominance in the brains
of our Revenue Officers. We commend the subject to the earnest
attention of Government, and hope they will reconsider the whole matter,
since justice and expediency equally demand that the ryot be left
unfettered in the enjoyment of the fruits of those improvements which he
may be at the pains and expense to bring about.  
  
  
  THE LAND SETTLEMENT IN NERIAD TALOOKA.  
  
  
  (Native Opinion, Nov. 29, 1868.)
II.


In our issue of the 15th instant, we stated, in general terms, the nature
of the glaring injustice to which the ryots of this talooka were
subjected by the recent settlament. We are glad to find that our
contemporary of the Times of India has deemed the question of sufficient public
importance to draw tbe attention of Government to it. Perhaps, it may
be as well to put our observations into a definite shape, so as to enable
our readers to see the real position of the question. The results of the
Survey Settlement may be summed up in a few words. The talooka of
Neriad comprises 76 villages, of which 26, or about a-third, are held
from Government under the Narwadari tenure, the rest of the land being
either alienated, or held directly from Government. The total area of
cultuiable lands in the whole talooka is 1,28,159 acres, of which 55,821
<!-- Leaf 103, Page: 93 -->
belong to Government, and 72,338 acres are alienated. The new rates
of assessment fixed by the Survey are as under :—  
  
  
  Neriad Talooka.
1st Class Lands assessed at Rs. 6 4 0 per acre.
2nd „ „,580 „
3rd „ „,,540 „
4th „,,,500
5th „,,,480 „
6th „ „,,380


In addition to these rates of assessment, arrived at after a most careful
consideration of several points, such as climate, capabilities of the various
soils, condition of agricultural skill, and the distance of markets,
Government has, for the first time in the history of this talooka, thought fit to
sanction an extra cess on water, called Bagayet Kussur, on all garden lands.
The maximum Bagayet Kussur is fixed at Rs. 7J per acre. We shall
show, however, that it is actually more. The financial result of the
settlement is a total revenue to Government of Rs. 3,72,833-5-0, made
up as follows :—

Revenue from Government Lands.. 2,51,123 15 0

Do. do Alienated do 1,21,709 6 0  
  
  
  Total... Rs. 3,72,833 5 0


This revenue, compared with the collections under the old system,
shows a net increase of about 10 per cent. The gross amount is, perhaps,
the largest shown by any tolooka of equal size in the whole of Gujarat.

We should not at all grudge this increase and this revenue to the
State, did we not find that an important item of it was wrung from the
ryots by the levy of a cess, wholly indefensible either on the grounds of
justice or expediency. The Bagayet Kussur upon Government and
Alienated lands amounts to Rs. 39,011-4-0, or more than 9 per cent, of
the entire revenue of the talooka. This Kussur, we say, operates most
injuriously upon the industrious portion of the cultivators. It is opposed
to the very essence of the Narwadari tenure, on which a considerable
portion of the land of this talooka is held. It appears to us that either
the true nature of the Narwadari tenure is not comprehended, in its
entirety, by our revenue survey and settlement officers, or that they
wilfully violate the most solemn obligations that the tenure requires to
be observed by Government. The Narwa tenure confers mutual
ohligations. The way in which it worked under the former Government
was this. The Government was either too idle, or too cunning to
manage its own village lands. It, therefore, consented to an
arrangement by which it secured its revenues with the least trouble and
expense. It agreed to receive a lump sum from the principal
Patels of a village, who were bound jointly and severally to
<!-- Leaf 86, Page: 76 -->
with. I know several instances of wells left unfinished because water
was not found in them.


\"27. I do not think also, that tho increase of assessment upon the
dry-crop lands, required to make up for the abandonment of a garden
assessment, will always be so inappreciable in amount as Mr. Ellis
expects. In Cliiklee for instance, the assessment of cultivated dry-crop
lands will be about Rs. 1,30,000 and of garden lands (not including rice)
about Rs. 65,000. Deducting those dry-crop lands in which, from their
elevated situation or other reasons, there is no probability of water being
obtained, the rate of increase in the dry-crop assessment required to
make up for the relinquishment of a separate garden assessment, would
certainly be not less than annas 8 in the rupee, and we should I fear run
a great risk of throwing much land out of cultivation.


\"28. There is another point which Mr. Ellis has, I think, overlooked,
and which neither Major Francis nor Mr. Rogers has noticed. If I
understand Mr. Ellis' proposal, he intends that the classers shall ascertain
those lands in which there is a reasonable probability of water being
obtainable, and allow for this probability by an addition to the
classification annas. But this presupposes that in all districts and villages an
uniform proportion between wet-crop and dry-crop rates, or rather
between the dry-crop rate of lands in which water is procurable, and that
of lands in which it is not, can be maintained. This is far from being
the case. In Chiklee, for instance, when there is a great deal of very
superior rice and garden land, and the dry-crop soils are of inferior
quality, the people put all their capital, labour and.manure, upon their
wet lands, and grow only grass or the commonest grains in their dry
soils, and we have consequently found it absolutely necessary to reduce
the dry-crop rates which, upon other considerations, we originally
proposed, and there are other districts in which the dry-crop cultivation is
almost as careful and valuable as the wet-crop." ° ° °


14. I trust you will do me the favour of causing a copy of this letter
to be furnished to Major Francis, who is under the impression that the
system of bagayut assessment adopted in Gujarat has been found
defective. Now it is not the system that is'defective in itself—for I am humbly
of opinion it is the best that could be devised,—but it is the difficulty
of administering and working it after the assessment has been completed.


15. I will adduce some examples. The settlement of a district has
been completed. For some time all goes on smoothly. Suddenly either
from the shock of an earthquake or from some other unknown cause, a
few wells or a great many wells (in one village or in several villages of
the district which have hitherto been sweet, and, have been assessed as
such) turn brackish or salt. Now (as you are well aware) there are
several grades of brackish water which we define as brackish, brackish
drinkable, brackish undrinkable, and salt. As soon as the Collector
<!-- Leaf 80, Page: 70 -->
re
"11. Besides the mode of assessment which we have adopted for
these lands, there are two others which we have rejected—

Is..—A rate might be imposed upon each bag annually used to lift
the water. This plan is objectionable for two reasons. The
man who goes to the trouble and expense of raising wet crops
would have to pay more than his neighbour who with equal
natural advantages grows only dry crops, and the bag rate is
therefore a direct tax upon industry and capital, and also, the  
  
  
  bag rate requires continual inspection, and even with the  
  
  
  
greatest care is easily evaded.
2«d.—Or those lands alone which at the time of classification are  
  
  
  found to be actually irrigated might be assessed at full
permanent garden rates. Nearly the same objections apply here
also, and in even a greater degree. The skill and capital of the  
  
  
  more enterprising cultivator would be taxed, and not annually,  
  
  
  but for ever, while the man who had made use of the natural
advantages of his land would be let off, and after the settlement,
it would often happen that the lands assessed at bagayut rates  
  
  
  would be thrown up, and the remaining lands irrigated.


\"12. The mode of assessment which we have therefore adopted is as
follows : the lands are first classed as dry-crop, and their natural
capabilities for irrigation then classed and entered in a separate column of
the registers, according to a scale calculated on their distance from the
source of supply, and the difficulty and expense of raising the water.
We can then permanently assess the water privileges at whatever
maximum rate we please. Of course the rate would be higher in a village like
Kullolee Jytulpoor, nearly every acre in which is watered from the
Kharee or Saburmutty; there is one in which perhaps only 2 or 3 dhekorees
are annually used. Our object is to spread the garden assessment which
under a bag rate or crop rate system would be received from the lands
generally irrigated, over the whole area which we can ascertain to be
capable of irrigation. Government thus loses nothing, the extra rate for
water is not so high as to throw out of dry-crop cultivation fields which
belong to people not rich or energetic enough to grow wet crops, while
those who avail themselves of their water privileges can make large
profits.


\"13. There is another advantage from the mode of assessment which
we have adopted for the last two classes of irrigable land. It is, that on
the expiry of the term for which the permanency of the Summary
Settlement is guaranteed, the assessment on the lands can be raised or
equalised without the necessity of a fresh classification. Thus, if there are
two villages each possessing 200 acres of land irrigated from a river, and
in one 100 acres are annually irrigated, iu the other only 10; we should
very likely fix the maximum water rate in the first village at Rs. 5 per
<!-- Leaf 118, Page: 108 -->
between the lump sum and the amount of the assessment come to by the
Revenue Survey is made up by the amount of cess on wells, which is for
the first time levied by the new survey.  
  
  
  YOUR ORIGINAL CORRESPONDENT.  
  
  
  THE LAND SETTLEMEN^MN NEEIAD.  
  
  
  TO THE EDITOR OF THE " TIMES OF INDIA."  
  
  
  (Times of India, December 23, 1868.)


Sib,—I promised that I would write no more about tbe Neriad
settlement question, but I have just received authentic information regarding
the rates actually imposed upon the garden lands of the Neriad talooka;
which shows that Native Opinion has made so gross a misrepresentation
of the facts, that in justice to the Gujarat Survey, I ought to expose it.
Native Opinion has taken the total nominal " kussur" or extra assessment
upon all garden lands, alienated as well as Government, (which, as you
are aware, though recorded, is not levied, in the case of alienated lands),
and has divided this sum by the number of water-bags in Government
wells (that is, in wells situated in Government land) alone; thus
showing an average rate per bag of Rs. 19, whereas, as I shall show, the rate
is really under Rs. 9.


The total number of water-bags, alienated aB well as Government, in
Neriad talooka, is 4,347; the area of land which was ascertained to have
a right to water from these bags is 11,930 acres; and the area of land
which was assumed by the Survey to be annually irrigable, (an allowance
being made for a rotation of dry-crops) is 7,614 acres, each bag being
thus assumed to be capable of watering on an average the very moderate
area of 1J acres. The total " kussur" imposed upon the 4,347 bags is
Rs. 39,011, a rate on each bag of something under Rs. 9; on each acre
having a right to water of about Rs. 3-3; and on each acre assumed to
be annually irrigable of about Rs. 5-2.


The information I have received gives the total nominal assessment
on all lands and wells, alienated as well as Government, but as alienated
lands are assessed for purposes of record, on exactly the same
principles as tbe difference between the figures here given and those for
Government lands only, cannot exceed a few annas per bag.

I believe that the average dry-crops rate per acre in Neriad is about
Rs. 3. The total assessment, inclusive of well " kussur," on each acre
annually irrigated will thus be a little over Rs. 8. The Nurwadars of
Neriad kusba, to my knowledge, sometimes sublet their garden lands at
a rent of Rb. 40 or Rs. 50 per acre, and the assessment rates upon garden
lands in the Gaekwar's district in Guzerat are Rs. 30, Rs. 40, and even
Rs. 60 per acre, while I have heard that an exemption from extra
<!-- Leaf 50, Page: 40 -->
asbut simply provides means for raising the water stored in the subsoil
to the surface and applying it to the land. The well is the production
of the cultivator's capital, but the water is not. The operation is exactly
analogous to the opening of a new mine, until which time the
subterranean mineral lies "useless to man and yields nothing to the
proprietor of the land in which it exists. But when once capital supplied the
means of bringing the mineral to tbe surface in a form suitable to man's
wants, it immediately acquires value, and yields rent or royalty to the
proprietor of the land from which it is extracted. Water, like minerals,
is a subterranean product of great value in tropical climates, and therefore
capable of legitimately yielding a rent to the lord of the soil who is the
Government in the present case."


Sir George Wingate's statement of the case is fair enough;
but the preponderance of his view in favour of the State's claim
of royalty does not seem, in my opinion, to be fully established.
It is undoubtedly true, as maintained by Sir George, that
the cultivator's application of capital and labour does not create
water for irrigation, but is it not equally true that though it
does not create water, it does create the applicability of the water
to the useful purposes of irrigation ? For ages together the
water in the subsoil may have remained, and does remain,
dormant,without acquiring the least value at all, and without the
Government being able to receive a particle of consideration
for its existence there. What is it, then, which gives it value
but the application of labour and capital rendering it accessible
to the use of man ? It is this which imparts value to it.
Let the State spend the capital, and it becomes perfectly
entitled to the tax it may impose upon it. But when the
importer of value is the cultivator, he acquires an indefeasible
right over the property thus brought into use. It may be urged
that if the water in the subsoil, of which Government is the
owner, did not exist at all, all the expenditure of capital and
labour on the part of the cultivator could not have brought it forth.
But for its existence the whole capital should have gone to waste.
But here it may be observed that, after all, it is difficult to
mathematically determine the respective shares of capital and
labour on the one part, and of the hidden natural resource on
the other, in bringing about the desired product in the form in
which it may be used for the comfort of man. It is like the case
of two factors of a product, where it would be difficult to say

  EXTRACT from the Proceedings of the Government of Bombay,  
  
  
  Revenue Department, dated \st May 1865.  
  
  
  Road the following papers :—  
  
  
  Letter from B. H. Ellis, Esq., Revenue Commissioner N. D., to F. S.  
  
  
  
Chapman, Esq., Officiating Chief Secretary to Government, Bombay,

No. 1021, dated 28th Marcii 1865.
I have the honor to forward a letter from Mr. Pedder, Settlement

Officer in Gujarat, to the address of the Superintendent of Survey,
recommending that the extra assessment on garden lands watered by wells
in the settled districts of Kaira and Ahmedabad be commuted by
offering: the occupants a remission of their well assessment in
consideration of the payment at once of a certain number of years' purchase of the
annual water-rate.


{empty}2. The Superintendent of Survey, Captain Prescott, in forwarding
Mr. Pedder's letter, recommends the proposition for sanction, stating—


\"To any person whc has had practical experience of well assessment
in Gujarat the advisability of securing to the State this very precarious
source of revenue by the payment once for all of a lump sum is very
apparent, and if, as Mr. Pedder suggests in his 4th paragraph, the
realization by such sales could be applied to local improvements, there can be
no question the measure would be attended with the best results.


\"But the Superintendent fears that such sums would be considered the
price of the redemption of a certain portion of the Imperial land revenue,
and consequently not available for local purposes."


{empty}3. I would urge on Government the adoption of Mr. Pedder's
suggestion, commencing, as proposed, with the Muhoonda talooka. The
proposition rests on very different grounds from schemes for a general
redemption of land revenue. The revenue is precarious, and the systems
adopted to secure it involve trouble and vexation at the best.  
  
  
  4. The ordinary rules of Sir Charles Wood's Despatch, therefore, do

Quoted in the margin of not apply toj this case. Nobody would give
H£fc^^S twenty-four or twenty-five years' purchase, nor
8rd August 1863. could Government demand so much in excess of
the fair value. I think that, looking to the precarious nature of the
revenue, fifteen years' purchase, as proposed by Mr. Pedder, may be
offered. The extra assessment on account of the wells would thereby be
got rid of, and the land would remain assessed, and liable to assessment
at dry-crop rates, to be revised when the assessment of other similar
lands comes under revision.


{empty}5. In a separate letter I am about to submit to Government a
proPosition to change the whole system of well assessment in Gujarat and
<!-- Leaf 36, Page: 26 -->
are merely holes dug into the ground to a depth sufficient to
enable the cultivator to obtain the requisite supplies for his field,
or patch of ground. As a matter of course, these wells do not
last more than two or three seasons. Their cost is also
insignificant. The cultivator has recourse to them whenever he needs a
supply of water for his crop. For monsoon crops they are not
required; but for such garden produce as sugar-cane, ginger and
other wet crops grown extensively in the Chikiee and Bardoli
talookas, these Kutcha wells are of first importance.


In the Kaira zilla, however, where a considerable depth below
the surface of the soil must be reached to obtain a water-bearing
stratum, the necessity for permanent wells is great. And
accordingly you find strong masonry wells built by the ryots at
considerable expense. Most of the owners of wells in this zilla,
especially in Neriad, Borsud, Muhoondha, Kuppurvunj, &c. are
Nurwadars. The wells are sunk into lands held on the Nurwa
tenure. And the general complaint on the part of these
proprietory cultivators regarding the recent land settlement is that
whereas these wells were hitherto free from any impost whatever,
the new settlement lays a heavy and unjustifiable cess on water

—of which the facility has been obtained by them and their
ancestors by employing their hard-earned savings in the construction
of permanent wells. It is, moreover, a charge upon capital sunk
in agricultural improvements, of which the levy can, on no
principle of economy, policy, or justice, be defended as right and
proper.
<!-- Leaf 93, Page: 83 -->
have been sunk by the cultivators at their own expense and labour.
Many of them were constructed as far back as the date of the previous
Government, and were kept in repairs by the ryots at their own cost. I
must tell you that most of these wells are from 80 to 100 and 120 feet
below the surface of the ground, and are so wide as to be capable of
admitting into them twelve kosas (leather bags) to draw water at the
same time. The average cost of constructing these wells cannot, I think,
have been less than Rs. 2,000 each. At this rate, the ryots of Neriad,
who have been cultivating lands from Government, may be said to
have expended out of their own pocket, about two and a half
lakhs of rupees for the purpose of constructing wells, and for this action
on their part—the results of which have benefited both the
Government and the ryots, in the shape of increased assessment to the
former, and of greater produce to the latter, the ryot is made
to pay a sort of penalty in the form of increased garden rates
instead of dry crop rates, which before the settlement used to be
levied upon them. If this is not taxing improvements, and thus
discouraging ryots from sinking wells any more in places where they
are most urgently required, I don't know what is, for where is
the guarantee that at the period ot the next revenue settlement, garden
rates shall not be charged for those lands which now pay dry crop rates,
but which may have wells sunk in them during the currency of the
present settlement ? When some of the wells on whose account additional
charges are now levied were first constructed, or in course of construction,
the authorities of the time had, with a view to encourage such
undertakings, not only promised to levy no additional water rate, but had actually
exempted such ryots from the payment of Government land revenue for a
certain period. I am informed that about the Sumvat year 1883-85
(corresponding with the English year 1827-29), when Mr. Thomas Williamson
was in Kaira, either as Collector or Revenue Commissioner, I cannot say
which, he issued a circular the purport of which was that any cultivator
sinking a well in the land held from Government would not only have
no increased assessment levied on his land on account of the additional
advantage thus obtained, but should be exempted from paying
Jummabundy rate for a certain number of years. I have not by me the exact
date of this circular, but it can, no doubt, be easily obtained by
Government from the records of the time, either in the office of the Kaira
Collector or of the Revenue Commissioner. You will, at all events, see that
the ryots have some reason to look upon Government as acting contrary to
the spirit of faith and assurance given in this circular. Government is
perfectly entitled to charge the ryots the ground rent of lands taken up by
these wells. I will even go so far as to concede to Government the right
to charge a higher rate in the case of lands taken up by wells, but I demur
<!-- Leaf 65, Page: 55 -->
fixed high special bagyut rate will meet all the requirements of the
case.


13. The Superintendent thinks it is worthy of consideration whether
in future the assessment of pucka wells, in Gujarat, may not be got rid
of by slightly raising the dry crop maximum rates, so as to meet the loss
of revenue occasioned by striking off the bagayut kussur.


14. In a conntry where wells can only be sunk by blasting through
the solid rock, this principle would be entirely inapplicable, as the many
would have to pay for the advantage of the few, but in Gujarat, where
everybody can procure water at little expense, the advantage might,
justly, be considered in fixing the maximum dry-crop rates.


15. It may be urged that this plan would answer in a poor district
where bagayut cultivation is limited, but that in a highly irrigated
country the result would be a great sacrifice of reveuue. The Superintendent
does not think that this would be a necessary consequence of the
measure. By a judicious grouping of the villages for water in addition
to other advantages, all the difficulty might be got rid of.


16. The Superintendent would first group the villages, as at present,
according to the advantages they possess as regards markets, roads,
climate, &c. He would then put every village into its proper
class for water, classing water under three heads—Sweet, Brackish, Salt
—and then for depth from the surface.  
  
  
  
Sweet.
Under 20 feet, 1st Class.
Under 30 feet, 2nd Class.
Over 30 feet, 3rd Class.  
  
  
  
Brackish.
Under 20 feet, 2nd Class.
Under 30 feet, 3rd Class.
Over 30 feet, 4th Class.  
  
  
  Salt.

Under 20 feet, 3rd Class.

Under 30 feet, 4th Class.

Over 30 feet, 5th Class.


Each of these classes would have an anna value, which value would
be incorporated in the dry-crop rate.


17. As the water-bearing stratum and the quality of water run very
even in Gujarat, over certain known tracts, grouping for water would
not be at all difficult, but in special soils (like those met with in the
southern districts of Surat,) when the water may be said to be
incorporated in the soil like bhatta, a special classification and special rate
would always be necessary.


18. In apologizing for this digression, the Superintendent, in
conclusion, would respectfully recommend that the redemption of the well
kussur, in Muhooda, should be offered to the occupants, as proposed by
Mr. Pedder, in order that the popularity of the measure may be
tested.

out market sites, invited artizans, such as blacksmiths, carpenters,
bricklayers to live there. The holders- of shares—called
Bhagdars, and, latterly in the Kaira zilla, Nurwadars—were thus
proprietors of large estates, and the real developers of the
resources of the country, the other settlers—holders of mujmoon
lands—forming the non-proprietary body. This is, in brief, the
original Bhagdari tenure which, with certain new features added
to it, forms the present Nurwadari system of tenure in Gujarat.
The number of villages held on this tenure in Gujarat are in
all about 347, of which there is only one in Ahmedabad,
90 in Kaira, 244 in Broach, and about 12 (the number is
uncertain) in Surat zilla. The Bhagdari system received much
encouragement in the early period of the history of Gujarat,
especially where waste lands had to be peopled. Even up to
the period of the Maratha rule, it continued to obtain support
from Government, since it led to the opening of new sources of
income to the State as well as to the community. Mr. Pedder
quotes the following instance :—


\"A curious illustration of the process I am describing may be drawn
from the history of the family of the Bhow Saheb, Dessai of Neriad.
This gentleman belongs to one of the original families of village
proprietors in Neriad Kusba, in which village he still holds as a Nurwadar his
hereditary share of land. Many years ago his ancestors were made by
the Moguls or Marathas, Dessais of the purgunna, and during the Maratha
rule acquired considerable wealth by farming the revenues of other
villages, and towards the end of last century one of hie Ancestors peopled two
waste villages in Muhoonda (of course according to Mr. Campbell's
' aristocratic' system) of which the Bhow is still patel."


It remains now to see what relations subsisted—1, between
the Bhagdars as among themselves; 2, between Bhagdars and
the non-proprietary class; and 3, between Bhagdars and
Government.


As regards the relations of the Bhagdars among themselves
each member of the original proprietary body was the holder
of one of the large shares or estates into which the village
lands were divided after setting apart a portion to form the
mujmoon or common lands to be held by non-proprietary
cultivators. In process of time, however, as the family of each

  THE " BAGAYUT KUSSUR" AND ITS PRESSURE
UPON PRODUCE.


It is scarcely possible to judge of the real merits of the issues
involved in the question of well-assessment in connection with the
land revenue settlement in any district of this Presidency,
without well marking the positions of those who have taken part in
the controversy and have looked at it from different points of
view. This would also enable us to determine how far the
views held by the different revenue settlement officers are borne
out by the actual circumstances of the country. At the close of
the volume on Kaira, the reader has laid before him the whole
correspondence on the subject, of which it is necessary to note
and examine the most salient points.


It must be mentioned here injustice to Government that the
principal points of the controversy regarding well-assessment do
not relate to future assessments on wells, nor to the assessment
of such wells as have been entirely built or repaired at the cost
of Government. It is only in respect of wells which have long
been in existence, and which have been constructed by private
enterprise, and on which the assessment was never before levied,
in any distinct form or manner, but has come to be separately
charged in the revised settlement lately introduced, that the
ryots and well-owners feel the cess as a grievance. To the
consideration of this point chiefly the remarks in the course of this
article will be directed.


Let the reader carefully go over the following extract from a
letter* dated January 31st 1867 from Major C. J. Prescott
one of the ablest Settlement Officers, to A. Rogers, Esq., the
Revenue Commissioner, N. D. Major C. J. Prescott observes :—


\"We attempt to defend the false principle of taxing capital
expended in sinking wells by the argument that as the produce of
garden land is greater, so the share thereof due to Government

evidently required. The settlement officer had to adjust a
re-disribution of shares in cases where it was found that the lands
they orginally comprised no longer formed part of them at the
period of the new survey. This re-adjustment has, upon the
whole, been carried out satisfactorily. As regarded lands, which
though originally forming portions of the Nurwa, but which in
process of time had become alienated—the Nurwa Barkhali lands
—an arrangement was come to with the holders thereof, by which
their rights and titles were placed for ever on an unquestionable
footing by their submitting to a summary settlement of four
annas in every rupee of assessment to which the lands would be
liable, provided they were held as Government lands. This
arrangement seems to have given general satisfaction, since it has
been the means of setting at rest an endless variety of disputes

and questions which were raised against their holders.

At the period of the revised settlement, the Kaira zillacomprised six talookas, viz., Neriad, Borsud, Mehomedabad (late
Matur), Mahoonda, Kuppervunj, and Thasra.* Of these, the
talookas of Neriad and Borsud are mostly Nunvadari, that is to

villages in the latter, are held on that tenure, the rest of the
talookas, except a ft?w villages in the Thasra purgunnah, are Klialsat
senja, the lands being held directly from Government. There is,
besides, a large extent of alienated land in all these talookas,
amounting, in some cases, to as much as 50 per cent, of the entire
area. The following tables will show at one view the respective

item that is to be taken in order to ascertain the garden rate. It is
wrong to take the number of irrigable acres of land, and divide the
total amount of the Bagayat Kussur by it to ascertain the garden rate.
A piece of land may be irrigable, and yet not irrigated. The holder of
irrigable land may have a right to the use of water from a neighbouring
well, but he may hold that right in abeyance, and, as long as he does
this, Government has most assuredly no right to charge him for a
possible advantage. The actually irrigated or Bagayet lands are, we repeat.
3,705 acres, so that the average garden rate is the quotient of the total
amount of the Bagayat Kussur, divided by the number of irrigated acres.
Aver, garden rate is '^r«=Rs. 10-8 5 per acre, which is just double
the rate calculated by the Survey Department I First class lands are
thus subjected to an assessment of Rs. 16-12 5 per acre !


Again, let us view the same in another way. There are altogether
2,104 water-bags (Kosas, as they are called in Gujarat) used to draw
water from the wells of the talooka. The gross amount of the Bugayat
Kussur being Rs. 39,011, each water-bag has about Rs. 19 charged upon
it by the new Survey. Supposing that a well contains water enough
for 5 water-bags, on an average, to draw water from it. The charge on
each well, therefore, is Rs. 95 (19 X 5), and yet the cess is termed a
moderate charge !


A great deal has been made of the right of Government to levy a
water rate. We are referred to Section XXV. of Act I. of 1865,
foi*authority for tbe levy of assessment either directly on land, or on the
means of irrigation, such as wells, &c. But a most important principle
has been overlooked iu the application of this Section, Surely, the
' means of irrigation,' therein alluded to, are those of Government's
making, or at any rate, where the State has contributed towards
bringing them into existence. And here the right of the State to a moderate
tax would be unquestionable. But what are the facts in regard to
Neriad and other talookas of Kaira zilla ? The means of irrigation in
these talookas are of the ryot's creation.


The cess on wells is called Kussur, which means, 'defect' or. '
deficiency.' We shall explain how this ' Kussur' or ' deficiency' has come into
play. Though the Narwadars pay a gross amount annually, yet every
field, together with every well, has been surveyed, measured, and assessed
in accordance with the rules of the Survey Department. By this means
the amount of the total assessment is arrived at. This is compared with
the lump amount paid by the Narwadars, and the deficiency is made up
by tho cess on wells.


If the object of the new Survey in the levy of a water cess be to lower
and equalize,, as far as possible, the land assessments of a talooka, we
emphatically say that it utterly fails to accomplish it.

  THE LAND SETTLEMENT IN NERIAD,  
  
  
  (Times 0/ India, 22nd Nov. 1868.J  
  
  
  TO THE EDITOR OF THE " TIMES OF INDIA."


Sir,—I have just returned from a short tour, and find in looking into
the back numbers of the Times of India, that you publish my letter of
the 21st September, and notice my complaint regarding extra assessment
levied on the ryots on account of well irrigation in the talooka. "You
observe that I have been misinformed on the subject, since you consider
it to be one of the chief merits of the Bombay Revenue Settlement that
it does not tax improvements. You, however, deem it proper to bring
the complaint to the notice of Government. Further, I find in your
issue of the 30th ultimo, that in again referring to the subject, you seem
tacitly to acknowledge the truth of my complaint, and in fact, to justify
the grounds which led Government, at the time of making the recent
settlement, to levy garden rates on well-irrigated lands, which before the
new settlement were only subjected to dry crops rates. Again, you
observethat Government is quite justified in doing so, considering that the
wells in existence at the time of the settlement had been either sunk or
put into repairs at the cost of the State, and that at the time when the
State made over to the cultivators these wells, there was an implied
understanding between the State and the ryot, or at all events, the latter
was aware, that he would have to pay extra charges on account of the
use of well water. I admit that you would be quite justified in arriving
at this conclusion, were the facts of the case such as you have described.
But you will allow me to observe that the facts are otherwise. I say this
from enquiries I have made on the spot. I find that the wells in the talooka
which were in existence at the time of the recent settlement were not
constructed at the expense of the State,nor had the State paid a farthing towards
their repairs. I talk of wells sunk in lands held from Government either
on the Narwa, or thirty years'tenure, and not of wells constructed or
repaired by Government for the use of the general public. To go no further
I take the town of Neriad alone, which for the purposes of assessment,
has been divided into five paties or wards. The greater part of land
surrounding the town is held from Government on the nurwadari tenure.
There are in all about 125 wells in this land, situated at various distances.
Of these 125, three wells are all that have received some support
from the State, chiefly in the shape of tagavi or advances, which have
been paid back to Government. With this small exception, all wells
<!-- Leaf 104, Page: 94 -->
pay a stipulated amount or ' Akara,' a margin being always left
to enable them to eke out their subsistence from their holdings. The
lands thus made over to the villagers were called ' Narwa,' a corruption of
the Sanskrit word ' Nirvaha' (•Tf^TT) meaning ' subsistence.' On the
other hand, Government, on its part, promised to levy no other tax on
land or water, nor to interfere in any way with its internal management.
The principal villagers, who were thus responsible to Government, divided
the village lands into certain shares or ' phalas,' which they either
cultivated themselves, or let out among tenants as they pleased.


The Narwadari talookas of Neriad, Matur, and Mahoonda,
together with the enam town of Kaira, and its dependencies, came under
the British jurisdiction by cessions by the Gaekwar on the 5th June 1803.
Government then promised to maintain inviolate and in its full
integrity the system of tenure it inherited from its predecessor. And be it
said to its honor that it did maintain the system in its integrity up to
the period of the new survey. Certain necessary modifications, chiefly
it must be confessed, in the interest of the Narwadars, were introduced in
regard to the payment of the lump assessment. For instance, instead of
making the Narwadars jointly and severally responsible to the State for
the payment of its dues, our Government held each Narwadar directly
answerable for his portion, or ' phala' only. This has certainly benefited
the Narwadar, since he is not now, as was the case under the old system,
bound to pay for the share of others, who neglected to contribute to the
gross assessment. But beyond holding the Narwadar responsible for his
share, our Government did not pioceed further till the period of the new
settlement. The Narwadar was left entirely to himself. He made his
own arrangements in regard to the raising of crops, and the payment of
rent by the tenant. The relations between the Narwadar and his tenants
have since undergone changes, the present policy of Government tending
to oust the former to be displaced by the latter. We cannot, however, go
into this question for the present. Suffice it to say, that the Narwadar
had every inducement to improve his holdings. Iu fact, he considered
his lands as private property, for, though the amount of the lump
assessment was liable to revision, and according as it was the same,
higher or lower, he was to bear his share, he never could be ousted out
of his possession. He expended his savings in sinking wells, procuring
manure, aud raised double crops where hardly a single crop was grown
before in abundance.


The finaucial results of this talooka, it must be carefully marked, are
not due to any inherent richness of the soil so much as to the patient and
laborious industry on the part of the cultivators. This is evident from
the different classes under which soils nearest to each other have been
assessed by the Survey Department. There are two classes of cultivators
<!-- Leaf 32, Page: 22 -->
  
  No. V.
IRRIGATION AND WELL ASSESSMENT.


It appears that of 481,697 acres of land in actual cultivation
in Kaira, the area devoted to garden cultivation is 22,749 acres,
that is to say, a little over 4^ per cent, of the cultivated area.
The rest of the land is devoted to khurreef or monsoon crops.
This may seem surprising enough, considering the capacity of
the land to produce more than one crop, and the general
intelligence, and industrious character of the Churotur kunbi, but it is
nevertheless the fact. And as this is more or less the
proportion of land producing garden crops in most of the zillas of
Gujarat (except, perhaps, Surat,) the question arises, What
are the obstacles to the extension of garden cultivation in the
Province? The Gujarat kunbi is not ignorant of the benefits
which would accrue to him if his land was rendered capable of
yielding more than one crop, looking to the fact that
wherever he has the facilities of doing so, he spares no amount of
labour or capital to raise more than one crop. What then are
the obstacles ? The answer is comprised in three words.
Irrigation and drainage. Irrigation and a scheme of drainage suited
to the condition of the country, are perhaps the two great wants
of rural Gujarat. It is a pity that in this matter the claims of
Gujarat should have been so wo fully neglected—as they have
been—compared with the Dekkan. So many useful projects of
irrigation have been and are still being pursued in the Dekkan
and Southern Maratha Country at an immense outlay of money
from the Imperial Exchequer that the only wonder is how it has
never entered the heads of those who preside over the Public Works
Department in this Presidency to do anything for Gujarat in this
respect. You have the irrigation tank at Ekrookh, near Sholapoor,
the storage lake near the town of Maynee in the Sattara district,
the Kurukwasla lake near Poona, and many other irrigation
schemes in the execution of which lakhs upon lakhs have
been expended, and are still spent. What similar projects have
been executed in Gujarat compared to this ? The claims
<!-- Leaf 85, Page: 75 -->
sharer in the well number, liable for the kussur only, and the entry in
the phusal putruk would be in the following form :  
  
  
  " A curious instance of this has just occurred during the settlement of

Bardoli. A cultivator who had a Government well and land was in
debt to a Waneea, who attached his well, and bought it at the auction
for Rs. 28, thinking that at the settlement, the land of the cultivator,
who would of course be recorded as having no right to take water from
the well, would be assessed at dry-crop rates, and that consequently he
would be able to get a piaow, or rent, for the water. We have entered
the Waneea's name as above, and have thus secured Government revenue
to the amount of Rs. 29 per annum.


\"25. I trust to be excused for this long description of our method. It
seemed to me very necessary that after the Survey Commissioner's
strictures upon it, it should be clearly explained. I am sure that Major Francis
would be the first to admit that the simplicity of the method of garden
assessment adopted in a district or province must depend upon the nature
of its water privileges, and of the modes of irrigation which prevail in it.
Our object has been whenever we can ascertain with tolerable accuracy
what are the water-producing capabilities of soils, to allow for them in
the permanent assessment, without regard to the existing means of
irrigation, and when we cannot, to assess those lands which actually
possess the means of irrigation is as simple, permanent, and equitable a
way as we can. If Major Francis will take the trouble to understand our
system, he will, I think, be convinced that it is neither so complicated
nor so unfair either to Government or the cultivator as he now supposes.


\"26. I will now proceed to offer a few remarks upon Mr. Ellis,
proposed system. I quite agree with what Mr. Rogers and Major Francis
have said regarding this. I am quite sure that the system would not be
applicable in a district like Chiklee, where in one field water can be
obtained by digging through earth to the depth of a few feet, while
another neighbouring field rests upon solid rock, and even in districts
like Duskrohie or Neriad, where this is not the case, where rock is not met
with, and where the springs are found at about the same depth, not only
as Mr. Rogers observes, are sweet and salt wells found close together, but
also it is by no means certain, on sinking a well a spring will be met
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P85_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 94, Page: 84 -->
to tbe policy, if not to the right of Government, to levy additional
assessment on account of wells constructed by ryots out of their own capital,
with the fullest faith in the promise of Government that nothing extra
should be charged on account of wells.


There are many other questions in connection with the land settlement
of this talooka in regard to which considerable misapprehension prevails
in the minds of the ryots, to clear up which should be the first duty of
Government. And no better way of doing this can be suggested than
an immediate publication of all papers connected with its recent
Revenue Survey and Settlement. No doubt, a considerable part of this
misapprehension and consequent dissatisfaction may be traced to the
ignorance of the principles which have guided Government in effecting
the settlement. I cannot understand what objection there can be on
the part of Government to delay the publication of these papers, seeing
that in regard to the settlement of the Indapoor talooka it has not been
thought proper to withhold all necessary information from the public.


My object here is not to seek or find fault with Government in the
matter of the Revenue Survey and Settlement of this talooka. I admit
that the Bombay Revenue Settlement possesses many merits of its own.
But it is only fair that in a prominent recognition of that fact, the
defects of the settlement and the injustice which it sometimes has
been the means of inflicting upon ryots should not be passed over in
silence.


I am afraid I have exceeded due limits; but tho importance of the
subject and the necessity of drawing your attention to the facts of the
case will, I hope, be deemed a sufficient excuse for my dwelling at some
length upon it.

TO THE EniTOR OF THE " TIMES OF INDIA."


Sir,—A letter of a correspondent signed " Neriad," which appeared in
your paper of the 22nd instant, is so pretentiously authoritative
regarding the accuracy of what the writer would call his facts, and so
speciously untrustworthy throughout that to counteract a tendency it has to
mislead, I beg you will allow me to fulfil a public duty by publishing a
few wOrds concerning the recent revenue settlement of the Neriad talook.
I shall do so, I trust, at little expense of your space, and my time; for
your correspondent shows so much i gnorance of the principles acted on
and the objects aimed at, by Government in making the settlement, as to
place anything like a controversy between him and me, which would
involve enquiry into the detail.of his letter, entirely out of the question.

is placed upon each well according to its capabilities and the area of
land irrigated therefrom, but no garden assessment, properly so called,
is placed upon the land irrigated or (as stated by you) upon
neighbouring lauds. Supposing a well to be capable, according to the survey
valuation, of irrigating five acres, a cess or kussur of say 25 rupees is imposed
on it; but supposing, after the settlement, 15 acres should be irrigated
from it,—no uncommon occurrence—nothing more than the fixed kussur
could be levied.


This kussur once imposed, occupiers may do what they please with
their water, and in addition to irrigating their own land, may use it for
the irrigation of any neighbouring dry crop land into which it will flow,
without incurring any penalty whatever. Of course, occupiers are just
as much at liberty to let or sell their water as their land, and to charge
anything they please for its use.


The advantage of this system of assessment is that in case of wells
being, for any reason, disused, the kussur can be at once struck off,
without disturbing or interfering with the land assessment.


You were in error in supposing that the imposition of this cess on wells
on Neriad is a departure from " the liberal views which have marked
the whole course of the settlement hitherto." Government has indeed
advocated all along, to a certain extent, the non-taxation of improvements;
and at the recent revision of the settlement of Indapoor, has taken
advantage of certain favourable circumstances which have enabled it to push
the principle to its ultimate consequences, and remit the assessment on
wells altogether. But it has never, in any original settlement, foregone
irs right to levy assessment in some form or other from wells already
in existence, unless they happened to be of very recent construction
or to be protected by some special agreement (gunicut), and the practice
followed in Neriad so far from being an innovation is in strict accordance
with the principles which have been acted upon at the first introduction
of the survey in every district hitherto settled. I hope that the
Indapoorrevision may prove to be the inauguration of a policy in all future
settlements as liberal as has always characterized the views of Government,
but whether this may be found practicable or not is a question
which must, of course, greatly depend ou special circumstances
affecting particular cases. X.

  GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE DISTRICT, ITS  
  
  
  SOIL, POPULATION, &c.


A BULKY volume of 762 pages (with a map) has lately been
issued by the Government of Bombay, containing
correspondence on the subject of the revision of the land assessment in
Kaira Zilla—one of the richest districts of Gujarat. As the
papers contain valuable information respecting the condition of
the people, the tenures of land, and interesting statistics
regarding population, markets, and physical resources of that part of
Gujarat—information to be looked for in vain in any of the
published records of Government—they form an important addition to
our literature of the Thirty Years' Settlement in this Presidency.
Our only cause of regret is that such reports should have been
so long withheld from the public gaze. At this very moment,
nearly the whole of Gujarat has been surveyed and settled, and
yet, What materials have been laid before the public to enable it
to judge of the merits of this settlement ? The volume before us
is the first authentic report of the second zilla settled, and while
it has been deemed important to publish correspondence
regarding this, it is surprising that the Bombay Government should
not have thought proper to publish papers connected with
the settlement of the Ahmedabad zilla, the first district in
Gujarat where the principles of the New Survey were
introduced in 1853. We urge the publication of such reports

Dharwar, and Sattara : and Khandeish iu the Northern Division. In
Gujarat it is still in progress. The only ziila where it has been
completed, and is now in actual operation, is Kaira, perhaps, one of the
most thickly populated of all the zillas of this Presidency.


With regard to the settlement of this district, it has been complained,
and complained justly, as the reader will find, that a heavy extra assessment
on account of well-water has been made to form an important item of
the land assessment. And the case of Neriad talooka has been brought
forward to illustrate the point. The culturable lands in Government
villages in the Kaira zilla is, or rather was, according to a return of
1858-59, about 692,614 Beegahs. Of this, by far the largest portion is
held from Government under various tenures. Some lands are
Khatabundee holdings, where the ryot is directly answerable to Government
for his rent. Others are held under what is called the Narwadari
tenure, according to which the villagers are bound to pay to
Government a lump assessment every year, while a not inconsiderable portion is
held under summary settlements, in accordance with the provisions of
Act VII. of 1863. Under whichever of the tenures the land is held
from Government or from private landlords, it is necessary that the
ryot must meet his payments to Government and to his landlord in the
regular instalments fixed for the purpose. He evidently looks to his
crop for the means to do this. Now, it is well-known that in Gujarat,
as in other parts of India, rain-water is the principal source to which a
cultivator wistfully looks for an abundant harvest. But he cannot
always depend upon it. He knows he may be disappointed at any
season as he has been many a time before. With the greatest economy,
therefore, he saves every pie from his income, denying himself
sometimes even the most ordinary comforts, and, at last, succeeds, with the
joint exertions of himself and his family, in sinking a well on his land,
which to him is a source of earning his bread—a source which, in
Gujarat, is, perhaps, as necessary as his pair of bullocks or his plough. It
may naturally be supposed that an enlightened Government such as ours,
would be the last to tax the ryot for introducing this kind of
improvement into his land, with a view to raise its quality. Section XXX. of
Act I. of 1865 thus provides for improvements :—


"It shall be lawful for the Governor in Council to direct, at any time, a fresh surrey
or classification of soils, or revision of assessment, or all or any of these combined, but
the assessment so revised shall not take effect till tbe expiration of the period of
previous guarantee given as provided in Section XXVIII. Such revised assessmeot
shall be fixed, not with reference to improvements made by the owners or occupants
from private capital and resources, during the currency of any settlement under this
Act but with reference to general considerations of the value of land, whether as to
soil or situation, prices of produce or facilities of communication."

THE NERIAD SETTLEMENT.
(Times of India, 20th December 1868.)


The Native Opinion has anticipated us in the notice of an important
question concerning the introduction of the Land Settlement of this
Presidency into the talook of Neriad in Gujarat. Our attention was
first drawn to the subject about two months ago by Mr. Javerilal
Oomiashunkur, a gentleman well known to our community, who was
lately traveying through the district. We think the question of
sufficient importance to justify the reproduction below of Mr.
Javerilal's letter, with the reply it elicited from the acting Collector of Kaira,
and the rejoinder of the former; omitting such parts of all three
documents as are not strictly relevant to the issue. The complaint is
shortly this, that lands that were formerly assessed at dry rates, on the
ground that the wells sunk therein had been made by the ryot himself
are under the new Settlement assessed at garden rates. They are so
assessed on the grouod that they are irrigated, without regard to the
fact that it was the ryot's own capital that provided the water. Not
only so; if Mr. Javerilal and Native Opinion are rightly informed, all
lands which lie in the neighbourhood of such wells, which can possibly
be irrigated therefrom, are assessed also at garden rates. So that
ryots who are unlucky enough to be in the mere neighbourhood of a well,
without any right to use the water have first to pay the State an
assessment based upon the supposition that they are its owners, and
then to pay the actual proprietor for permission to use it. Now if
these statements be true, and we have reason to fear they are, a
wrong is plaiuly being committed.


It is a leading principle of the new settlement [Section 30 of Act I.
of 1865] that all improvements made by the ryot under the 30 years'
leases shall be his own for ever. If his land is dry land at the time
when he gets his lease, it will be assessed as dry land for ever, unless
the State defrays the cost of its conversion into garden land by
irrigation. Under the new settlement, we say, a ryot who sinks a well upon
his land will enjoy for ever the profits which may arise therefrom,
without any claim thereon by the State. It seems, however, that in
introducing the Settlement, this equitable and wise provision is not
allowed to have retrospective force; on the ground that under the old
system, the ryot was aware, if he built a well, that he would be liable
to garden rates after 30 years. There may be no contest whatever as
to the fact that it was he who built the well, and paid for it; his
lease is still issued upon the assumption that the State built it.
He will be assessed at garden rates, for all time instead of dry rates.
Now this certainly looks unjust. It is no answer to say that under
the old system tbe ryot was warned if he built a well that he would
<!-- Leaf 98, Page: 88 -->
cussed with a punctilious regard for the welfare of the ryot, that is
distinctive of the revenue survey system and its officers, every point of
the settlement so as to make it fair and equable in its bearing on all
interests affected by it, and without a thought of introducing a measure,
framed merely to increase Government revenue at the expense of the

ryot' But who ever demanded so much information ? Mr.
Elliot could have easily spared all this flourish, and met my objections
by a plain statement of a few facts, even if he thought I was so
ill-informed of revenue affairs as to render it impossible to discuss them with
him. I am sorry to find, however, that he has hardly troubled himself to
meet a single point of my argument. The whole tone of his letter is such
as one could hardly have expected from a gentleman in his position.
Seriously, if men in such position, instead of using argunients, try to cry
down an opponent by making loose and indignant statements, the public
could hardly expect to bo enlightened by them on questions of vital
importance to the country.


And this tempts me once more to call the attention of Government to
the very urgent necessity which exists of at once publishing papers
connected with the revenue settlement of the Kaira Collectorate. If any
misapprehension exists on the part of the outside public in regard to the
land settlement of this Collectorate, it surely is not traceable to any
unwillingness on its part to obtain the desired information, but to a want of
access to authoritative works on the subject. This is the more necessary
when public officers, instead of supplying facts, furnish only loose and
indignant statements as has been the case in the present instance.

  THE LAND SETTLEMENT IN NERIAD TALOOKA.  
  
  
  (Native Opinion, 15ih Nov. 1868.)


So much has been urged in support of the Land Revenue System of
this Presidency, both in public prints, and in the reports of Revenue
Officers of Government, that one is naturally apt to dismiss as
unreasonable any complaint raised on behalf of the ryots against Government.
It seems to be forgotten that the so-called ' perfection' and ' beauty'
of the system, inaugurated in this Presidency by Sir George Wingate
and the late Mr. Goldsmid, require that it should meet the wants of the
ryot as well as of the State in a fair and honorable spirit. And, if the
professed object of Government in the introduction of a Thirty Years'
Settlement into the Bombay Presidency be to establish equitable relations
between the ryot and the State, it is the duty of its executive officers to
see that this object is properly gained. The settlement has been already
introduced into the several zillas of the Presidency. In the Southern
Division, it has been in operation in Poona, Ahmednuggur, Belgaura,

\"made by the owners or occupants from private capital and resources
\"during the currency of any settlement under this Act, but with reference
\"to general considerations of the value of land, whether as to soil or
\"situation, prices of produce or facilities of communication."


Believing that the reference to " improvements made by the
owners or occupants from private capital and resources,
during the currency of any settlement under this Act," could
be to no other than new wells, future well-owners have
reason to rest satisfied that the results of their employment of
private capital in promoting irrigation schemes shall be free from
taxation. Thus, to use the wrords of an eminent authority on
this side of India on questions connected with land settlement,
\"the most complete encouragement possible is given to the
development by means of private capital of the capacity for
irrigation which the country possesses." It is only to be hoped
that this interpretation will be strictly adhered to in future revised
settlements.


Consistently with the enunciation of this just and liberal
principle, owners of wells which were found to exist at
the time the revised settlement was introduced—and others as
have had no revised settlement yet introduced into their
districts, as, for instance, those in Broach, Punch Mahals and
parts of Surat Attavessy—these well-owners enquire, and
naturally enough, Why should not this fair and just principle
have a present or retrospective effect ? The principle is just the
same, and if it holds good in the ease of future well-owners, it
must hold equally good in respect of the existing owners, since
it is, like the principle of justice, eternal, being irrespective of
time or place.


Against the claims of the suffering well-owners it has been
urged as follows by the same authority whose words we quoted
above. As the views therein set forth are those of an
experienced Government officer, they are entitled to a careful
consideration. It is advanced :—

  LAND TENURES—(continued).


As may be expected, the peasantry who paid direct rents to
the State broke down under the weight of the capricious
demands of the Maratha Government in the shape of additional
cesses. The Maratha koomavisdar could ill-brook any symptoms
of prosperity on the part of the ryots. If the Kunbies of a
village were found to be a well-to-do class, possessed of
wellbuilt houses, or using copper, brass, or other metallic vessels
for domestic purposes instead of earthenware pots, or if their
wives and daughters were found to wear silver or golden
ornaments, they were suspected to have grown rich from the profits
of their land, and the Nemesis was sure to frown upon them.
A new cess was the inevitable result of the koomavisdar's visit.
It was levied under various pretexts. The Sirkar had expended
money on the marriage of a member of the royal family, or that
the new palace was estimated to cost more than could be spared
from the treasury. It was therefore found necessary to levy a
hoi vero (cess on ploughs), a khata vero, oodhur vero, or a tax in
any other form on government lands, and salamis, maliat
swadeos, and other cesses on alienated lands. The mischief of these
cesses was that the levy of them was continued long after the
objects for which it was required had been accomplished. In
bad years, especially, such levies drove the ryots to despair.
They were often found to desert their lands, their homes, and
their country.


The Bhagdari villages also suffered from the same cause. Mr.
Pedder gives an interesting history of Koobudthul, a Nurwadari
village in the Dushkroi purgunna of Ahmedabad, showing the
baneful effects of the Maratha system. In the course of a single
generation, the assessment of this village was raised from
Rs. 700 to Rs. 5,247. Every year the Maratha koomavisdar
went on increasing the amount of the jummabundy, to meet
which the proprietors had to sell their lands. " In Sumvut
-- 1869, the year of the famine," sayshe, " the koomavisdar
impri■■ soned the Nurwadars till they signed a blank agreement, which

alleged to have been followed in Neriad, that we think there must be
some mistake in the matter, and wait to hear it explained.  
  
  
  THE NERIAD SETTLEMENT.  
  
  
  (Times of India, 28th November 1868.)


We publish below several interesting letters upon the subject of
well assessment in the talook of Neriad. Government has also been good
enough to furnish us with certain official correspondence upon the
subject, but we await the publication of the papers connected with the
introduction of the settlement into the Kaira Collectorate generally,
before saying more upon the subject, beyond the expression of our
growing conviction that the case is one that should be dealt with by
compromise.  
  
  
  1.  
  
  
  TO THE EDITOR OF THE " TIMES OF INDIA."


Sir,—Referring to the articles on the Neriad assessment in your issue
of Friday last you will be glad to learn that Government has ordered the
immediate publication of the reports and correspondence connected with
the introduction of the Revenue Survey Assessment into the Kaira
Collectorate, and in the mean time I take this opportunity of correcting an
error into which you have fallen with regard to the assessment of garden
lands in the Neriad talooka.


{empty}2. Your correspondent's assertion that a water rate was never levied
either by the present Government before the Survey system came into
operation—or by former Governments would appear to require
modification. Excepting in Nurwa villages —the gross assessment of which
is paid by the sharers in certain paid proportions, altogether irrespective
of the area or quality of soil or of the number of wells actually in the
possession of any individual sharer—it was long the practice both of the
former and present Governments to levy a Jinuswar Bigotee (crop
assessment) or a share of the produce, under either of which systems it is clear
that the Government assessment was proportionately enhanced, whenever
water was used. Indeed, it may be asserted that in every description of
tenure, irrigated or garden cultivation has been made to bear, either
directly or indirectly, a heavier assessment than dry crop. Even in
Nurioa villages the gross assessment, which was liable to revision,
was fixed with general reference to what their capabilities would have
been under the systems above indicated. Direct taxes under the name
of malleat saivadio, piou, &c. were also levied on Government lands)
watered from alienated wells, or vice versa. By the survey, all garden
lands are assessed at dry crop rates, according to their relative value.
Under the provisions of section XXVI. of Act I. of 1865, a moderate cess
<!-- Leaf 110, Page: 100 -->

The alleged practice is so much at variance with the spirit in which
the new Settlement was conceived, and by which its course hitherto
has been marked, that we can hardly believe in its existence. A
valuable illustration of the spirit in which the Settlement has ever been
worked, is furnished by the Resolution of the local Government of 27th
March last, upon the resettlement of the Indapoor talook. Sir George
Wingate iu his remarks upon the report of Colonel Francis had stated
his impression that Section 30 was being interpreted with undue
liberality when it was held to exempt " land brought under irrigation by the
construction of a new well, or the repair of an old one from the
imposition of additional assessment on that account." Sir George pointed out
that though the well is the product of the ryots' capital, the water is not.
The sinking of a well, he says, is exactly analogous to the opening of a
mine. Water like minerals is a subterranean product of great value in
tropical climates, and therefore capable of legitimately yielding a rent
to tho lord of the soil, which in the present case is the Government. Of
the theoretic correctness of this view there can be no doubt, but tbe
local Government, in the exercise, as we think, of a wise liberality,
refused in its resolution of March last to act upon it. The passage is of
so much interest that we reproduce it:—


\"In regard to special taxation of wells, it is said with truth that water
\"is, like mineral wealth, fairly taxable by the landlord when used by the
\"tenant. His Excellency in Council, however, considers that the first
\"principle of its taxation should be that which governs our taxation of
\"the land itself, that is, the capability of being used rather than the use
\"itself. If water of good quality could be easily available near the
\"surface, it is more reasonable to tax such land by alight additional rate,
\"whether the water be used or not, than to lay an oppressively heavy tax
\"on those who expend capital and labor in bringing the water into use.
\"There is, however, a point at which this principle must be modified, for
\"when the land is such that when water is not brought to it, it will bear
"nothing, and when water is used it will yield a fine crop, then even a
\"light tax in the former case is impossible. Of this class are the sandy
\"tracts in the Konkun, which under the influence of water become
cocoa•' nut gardens. It must be held that the right of Government to levy a
\"rate by virtue of the water below the surface is in abeyance, or
dor" mant, till the water is produced, but it is doubted greatly, oven in this
\"extreme case, whether it is politic, though it may bo asserted to be
\"just, to levy more than would be leviable from first class rice ground,
\"which enjoys also the benefits of water, not created it is true by the
\"tenant, but utilized by means of his preparation of the ground."


Now these liberal views have marked the whole course of the settlement
to their, and they are so complete a contrast to the practice whichis
<!-- Leaf 79, Page: 69 -->

\"8. But in fixing the rates of assessment, there is something to be
considered beyond the depth at which water is procurable, and its
quality, and that of the soil. Wet crops are much more expensive to
raise than dry ones, and the profit upon them, though absolutely much
larger than on dry crops, are probably not so relatively. The extent,
therefore, of garden cultivation in any village depends upon the
proportion between the area of irrigable land, and the capital available for the
production of wet crops. Now, of two villages about equal in wealth
and population, one may have a large area of this natural bagayut land,
the other but a small one. In the latter case, the whole of the bagayut
land would be cultivated with wet crops as often as possible; in the
former, either all the fields comprised in the bagayut tract would grow
irrigated crops, but only at intervals of several years or more probably
the lands nearest the village or otherwise moBt favourably situated,
would alone be cultivated with garden crops. To assess the whole of
the irrigable lands of the latter village at the rate which the former
could afford to pay would check cultivation and progress in wealth. To
assess at garden rates those lands only which at the classification might
be found to be actually irrigated, would net only be unjust, as
throwing an extra tax on the skill and capital of the more enterprising
cultivators, but would endanger the revenue. For after the settlement, the
cultivators would very likely throw up the lands assessed at garden
rates, and irrigate those assessed only at dry crop rates, and to impose
in the village in which there is only a small area of irrigable land, and
that entirely cultivated with wet crops, only the low rates which the
other village could afford to pay upon its entire irrigable area would be
a useless sacrifice of revenue.


\"9. In a case like the above, therefore, we should make a difference
in the garden rates between the two villages. Nor in my opinion is this
inconsistent with principle. We are often obliged to vary even the
drycrop rates of neighbouring villages, because of differences between the
wealth or skill of their inhabitants. Much more must we do so in the
case of irrigated lands, the returns from which depend in so much
greater a degree upon the skill and capital employed upon them;
our settlement is not a permanent one, and at each periodical
revision of assessment it maybe expected that the temporary causes which
have led to differences in the rates will be found to have become less
powerful.


\"10. The third class of irrigated lands are those watered from rivers,
by dhekorees, which are places either built of masonry or simply dug in
the bank, and in either case at a trifling cost. Usually there is in each
village much more land capable of being irrigated in this way than is
actually irrigated, the proportion depending upon the agricultural capital
and energy of the cultivators.
<!-- Leaf 78, Page: 68 -->
\"3. Garden lands in Gujarat may be divided, with reference to the
mode in which they are irrigated, into 4 classes—  
  
  
  a.—Lands watered from tanks.  
  
  
  6.—Lands watered from kucha wells.
{empty}c.—Lands watered from streams and rivers.
{empty}d.—Lands watered from permanent wells.


And a very little consideration will show that these different kinds of
garden lands cannot be assessed in the same way.


\"4. The first class, a, is chiefly composed of rice lands, the irrigation
value of which is allowed for in the water classification, and which I
need not remark on.


\"5. In the second class, b, are comprised, 1st, the bhatta or river
lauds of the Ahmedabad and Kaira collectorates, described at the end
of paragraph 2 of Mr. Rogers' letter No. 1561 dated 15th ultimo, and
Indly, tho exceedingly fertile and valuable lands in the Surat
collectorate which we call " ootum prukar," and a large area of which exists
between Unklesur and the Nerbudda, and near the sea-coast between
Sucheea and Bulsar.


\"6. These lands are deep beds of the finest alluvial soil, generally of
a dark-brown colour. They are usually quite flat and are intersected by
tidal rivers, the Ainbeeka, the Kurreera, the Kaveri, &c, above the level
of which they are little elevated. Their limits are perfectly well defined
by an abrupt rise in the ground, and by a sudden change in the nature
of the land to the ordinary black or gravelly soils of that part of the
country. Water, not in all places of exactly the same quality, but
always good enough for the irrigation of sugar-cane, can in all parts
of these lands be procured at depths varying slightly according to the
locality, but always within a very moderate distance from the surface.
These lands are capable of producing the finest sorts of sugar-cane,
plantains, ginger, pineapples, pumpkins, &c, and in most of them such garden
crops are grown in rotation with dry-crops, but how often, depends upon
the energy and capital of the cultivators. They are irrigated either from
masonry wells, or from kucha wells, which are merely holes dug in the
ground, and do not last longer than one or two seasons. When a
cultiyator is ri<3h enough to grow a garden crop every year, he usually finds
it worth his while to build a masonry well, which costs only Rs. 40 or
Rs. 50, and will probably last 20 or 30 years. If, on the other hand, he
only grows a garden crop once in 5 or 6 years, he generally digs a new
kucha well when he wants it, at a cost of 5 or 6 Rupees.


\"7. Such lands as these I consider to be natural bagayut, and we
have therefore entered them in distinct columns of the Survey registers,
and have assessed them at garden rates, whether all the fields comprised
iu them are cultivated or not with garden crops at the time of the
classification.
<!-- Leaf 67, Page: 57 -->
Khandeish. If my views be approved, assessment will in future not be
imposed on wells at all, the revenue thereby lost to the State being made
up by the imposition of a slightly enhanced rate on all lands capable of
producing water. The lands of which the well assessment is now to be
commuted would, like other lands of the same class, como under this
settlement at the end of the guaranteed period.


{empty}6. The people will, of course, be made clearly to understand that the
acceptance of the offer of commutation is optional, and they should be
allowed time to determine whether or not they would accept it.


{empty}7. As regards the appropriation of the proceeds, I do not think that
Mr. Pedder's proposition to devote the amount realised to local funds can
be acceded to. But it would be a very legitimate mode of disposing of
the money if a sum not exceeding one lakh of Rupees be assigned for
the drainage of the Kaira district for the improvement of its agricultural
resources. Drainage works are as proper an object for the expenditure
of Imperial funds as Irrigation works, and yet sanction can seldom be
obtained; I would suggest, therefore, that one lakh of Rupees might be
asked for from the Government of India in addition to the ordinary
Budget allotment, at the rate of 50,000 Rupees per annum, to be
expended in the Revenue Department for drainage works in the Kaira districts,
in the course of the ensuing two years, the instalments for the
commutation of the well assessment being spread over the same period.

  Assessment in Gujarat, No. 23, dated 14th November 1864.  
  
  
  With reference to the correspondence marginally noted, relating to the

well assessment

dated 19th October 1864 posed by the burvey
Reply of Revenue Commissioner No. 3429, dated 29th October _,
1864, forwarded by Collector to Superintendent of Survey No. upon rice ana
gar1176, dated 2nd November 1864. <jen ian(j irrigated
from wells, I beg leave to make the following remarks :—


{empty}2. The reply of the Revenue Commissioner N. D. to the Collector's
letter sets at rest the question—which, indeed, a little consideration will
show can be decided only as it has been by the Revenue Commissioner—
whether when a well used for the irrigation of Government lands
becomes totally useless, the extra assessment (bagayut kussur) imposed
on such lands with reference to the capabilities of the well should be
remitted or not.


{empty}3. A well used for irrigation in the alluvial soil of Gujarat very
seldom pierces the rock, and consequently will rarely last, unless
considerable expense in repairing it be frequently incurred, for longer than from
twenty-five to fifty years. We may, therefore, reckon that the greater
portion of the well assessments imposed by the Survey will have been  
  
  
  S
<!-- Leaf 76, Page: 66 -->
any equitable means for making up the loss of revenue which would
be caused by its abandonment could be devised. When I submitted
my scheme—which was applicable as will be seen further on to
JerayutBagayut tracts only—I was fully aware that its adoption would be
attended with some difficulty, and that it would require very great study
before it could be applied, and although I was not prepared—as the
Revenue Commissioner supposed—to carry it out " sine die," 1 did not
consider the difficulties insurmountable, and hoped that my letter would
create discussion and'be the nucleus of a well-matured plan.  
  
  
  5. I very much regret that my letter referred to was not more clearly  
  
  
  expressed, for I remark that it has conveyed
{empty}. ■ __ i_ _.i_ _.
a wrong impression oi my meaning both to
your predecessor and yourself. In the first
piaoe my proposal had reference to
Jerayuta
Bagayut districts or tracts only, whereas the

Revenue Commissioner's letter

to Government No. 1561 of isth 
J_u.3V, ptirti. '2. 

plan proposed by the Revenue Commissioner could be applied in natural
Bagayut tracts or districts only.


{empty}6. It was never my intention to dispense with the classification of well
water. Under any circumstances it would have to be done to enable us
to collect the necessary data for grouping the villages for water
assessment.  
  
  
  What I intended was briefly this :—  
  
  
  (a)—To collect all the information regarding the capabilities of  
  
  
  wells, the supply, quality, and depth of water just as at present.  
  
  
  (&) —To put all villages in which no brackish or salt wells exist  
  
  
  into the 1st group, for water.  
  
  
  (c)—To put in the 2nd group those villages in which salt and  
  
  
  brackish wells are found mixed with sweet ones—on the
assumption that all existing sweet wells in such villages might turn
brackish or salt, and that new ones would be as likely to be  
  
  
  brackish as sweet.  
  
  
  (d)—To put villages in which no sweet wells were found into the  
  
  
  last group.  
  
  
  (e)—To sub-divide the groups on account of average depth of water.


{empty}7. Before determining the number of pies to be added to each
Rupee of the jerayut rate in every village on account of water, it would
be necessary to ascertain the average realisations on the Bagayut
cultivation, for some villages with every facility have very little of that kind
of cultivation, while others with half the advantages have a great deal.
In short it depends entirely on the caste and capabilities of the
cultivators whether water privileges are made the most of, or disregarded
altogether.


{empty}8. My plan is, therefore, simply to add a little to the jerayut rate of
every village in a Jerayut-Bagayut district, on account of water, the
<!-- Leaf 117, Page: 107 -->
former Government, and under the present Government up to the period
of the new survey, was that beyond receiving a lump assessment,
Government could not interfere with the management of lands. They
could levy no tax upon water.


{empty}3. " Under the provisions of Section XXVI. of Act I. of 1865, a moder
ate rate is placed upon each well "  
  
  
  n


It appears that much has been made of this section. It has been
interpreted in a manner which disallows the ryots the full enjoyment of
the fruits of his labour, and investment of his capital. Granted that this
section authorizes the levy of assessment directly on the means of
irrigation, such as wells, &c. But on what means of irrigation '? on what
wells ? Certainly not those towards which the State has not contributed
any capital. Where the State has contributed something towards
bringing these means of irrigation into existence, its right to levy a moderate
rate would be unquestionable. But what are the facts in regard to Neriad
and other talookas in the Kaira zilla ? The State has not contributed
a pie towards creating the well property. When the levy of Kussur or
water-cees is taken in connection with Mr. Thomas Williamson's circular
of 1827, the charge on wells becomes, I submit, a breach of faith on the
part of Government.


Again, when wells of recent construction are exempted from the
Kussur, what can justify Government to tax old wells ? Owners of old
wells have greater reason to be exempted, as they constructed them at a
time when the scarcity of wells was great, and the means of the ryots
very much more limited than they are now. It was by denying
themselves the most ordinary comforts of life that they could effect savings
enough to enable them to build wells.


It is stated that no garden assessment properly so called, is levied
upon lands adjacent to a well But it is admitted that the neighbouring
lands are assessed at their relative values, I say, that its capability of
being watered by a neighbouring well is taken into account, and this
circumstance, the mere capability of being watered, goes to raise the
assessment of garden lands (call it even dry crop) to a degree which makes
the ryot complain of the injustice of the settlement. It is here that he
suffers doubly. He pays Government for a possible advantage, which is
really no advantage to him.


The cess on water is called Kussur, which means, in Gujerati,'
deficiency.' Now, I shall explain how this ' deficiency' has come into play.
Though the Nurwadars pay a gross assessment annually, every field held
under the Nurwa tenure has been surveyed, measured, and assessed in
accordance with the rules of the Survey Department. By this means the
amount of the total assessment is arrived at. But as the Nurwadars pay
a lump sum every year, the ' deficiency' or ' Kussur' as it is called,
<!-- Leaf 56, Page: 46 -->
nue Survey has hit upon a third, known as the Bagayut Kussur
system. What this system is and how it is worked, may be
best learnt from the words of its author, Major Prescott. It
may be observed at the same time that the Bagayut Kussur,
though fixed upon land, is yet distinct from, and in addition to,
the dry-crop assessment. Major Prescott proceeds :—


The settling officer decides on an examination of each district or group
of villages how many acres a one-koss well working a certain number of
hours will on an average irrigate, and the rate of the bagayut assessment
which it will be proper to impose, and from this a table is drawn out.
Thus if it is found that a well working 9 hours can irrigate on an average

4 acres, and one working 6 hours 2+, acres, and that the proper rates, in
addition to the dry-crop assessment, will be, for a sweet well Rs. 5, for a
brackish one Rs. 2 per acre. The table would be in the following form:—


With the aid of this table, continues Major Prescott, it is
easy for the settling officer to fix the bagayut assessment for a

whole district, as according to the former system to fix that
ofa single large village. It is easy when the total
assessment on the well has been ascertained to distribute
the amount over all fields watered by it, in proportion to
the share of each holder. If there is any doubt about
the shares, we can postpone the distribution till the
Jammabundy, and then ascertaining the facts from the people who
are present, fill in the figures in 10 minutes, the survey
registers being complete, as far as the calculation of the dry-crop
rates is concerned. The correction of errors is also extremely
simple, i. e., at the jummabundy of Oomret, talooka Thasra, we
fouud that the garden rates which I had originally imposed were
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P56_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 71, Page: 61 -->
class of sweet water should be " over 30 and under 50 feet." Beyond
50 feet all water should be untaxed. But would not a simpler scale
suffice thus ?

Sweet water. Brackish. Salt.

Under 30 feet, 1st Class. Under 30 feet, 2nd Class. Under 30 feet, 3rd Class.

Above 30 feet and under Under 60 feet, 3rd Class.

50 feet, 2nd Class.


If you prefer a scale with more gradations you can keep the scale as
originally proposed, in that respect, but I would certainly resign all
claim to first and second class water below 60 feet, and to salt water
below 30 feet.


{empty}4. I think too that it will be necessary to instruct the Classing
Assistant to record in every village what fields should be liable to the
rate and what should be exempted. In future I would rather have the
rate put on as a part of the classing operations than reserve it for the
grouping. For it is obvious that in a village which you may have
justlygrouped for the sweet water available in it within 30 feet in the lower
situations, there are many high-lying fields where water could not possibly
be found at that depth, and the addition to the assessment would operate
very injuriously on these which would probably be the worst soils. It is
necessary, therefore, that it should be fixed by the Classing Assistant what
fields are to be liable to the addition for water. The fields of similar
water capabilities will usually be in large blocks, and it will cause very
little trouble to note at the time of taking the classing test what fields
should be raised for water. It is to be borne in mind that the amount
to be assessed will be very small and therefore excessive accuracy is not
required.

• Sir,—I have the honour to submit for the consideration of Government
the propriety of abandoning in future Survey Settlements in Gujarat and

Government I propose to make up by taxing the water-producing capability
of soils, or in other words, by slightly enhancing the valuation of land
in which water is obtainable close to the surface.

1865—forwarding his remarks on the subject.


Resolution.—The question submitted by the late Revenue
Commissioner, N. D., was whether a system might not be adopted for assessing
by a light rate the water-producing qualities of the soil, in preference to
the present system of assessing highly only such lands as are found to
be already supplied with wells.


{empty}2. The authority of Major Wingate is quoted in support of the
present system. But that able Revenue Officer admitted the correctness of
the principle advocated in the letter from the late Revenue Commissioner
{empty}N. D., No. 1045, of the 30tb March 1865, and it seems that he was deterred
from adopting the system, which be deemed to be better theoretically,
by the consideration that it would involve a large sacrifice of revenue,
and that the continuance of the system which he found in existence
would not be felt as a hardship if the assessment were properly adjusted.


{empty}3. In the discussion which has taken place there appears to have
been some misapprehensions, and questions not altogether relevant have
<!-- Leaf 55, Page: 45 -->
the Bombay Civil Service more intimately familiar with land
settlement questions relating to Gujarat, where he has spent
the best part of his life. Mr. Rogers observes :—" I have
known many instances in Gujarat where the very contrary of
this is the case, where of two wells, side by side, or only a
few yards apart, the one would be sweet and the other so
brackish as to be unfit for purposes of irrigation, and where
the mere cleaning out of a sweet well or deepening it but a
very little, would allow a salt spring to break in and spoil the
water. As far as my experience goes Captain Prescott's
assertion is only strictly correct with regard to Bhatta lands, lands
either in the beds or close upon the banks of rivers (in which
may be included a few old river courses, which, though dry
for the most part of the year, still have water flowing in them
in the monsoon freshes) where water is obtained not from
springs, but from percolation."


Again, there is another practical difficulty in regard to
classifying lands according to their water facilities which the classer
cannot always gel over, and that is in the case of lands whore
there are no wells. And though there are no wells, yet the
water capacity of the lands must be determined ! Now " how,"
as the question has been rightly put by Mr. Rogers, "how is he
(the classer) to tell the depth of water from the surface, or its
quality in any field in which there is no well to guide him ? He
of course cannot dig everywhere to ascertain, and it would be
throwing too strong a temptation in the way of a man drawing
perhaps from 20 to 40 rupees a month to allow him to put
down his surmises. Officers of higher rank above the
suspicion of yielding to temptation would simply throw up the
attempt in despair." Such is the statement of the most
experienced Revenue Officer in Gujarat. The affair of
classifying lands according to their water capabilities comes at best to
be one of " mere surmises," which in the hands of lowly-paid
men comes to be again an engine of oppression, and in the hands
of those above ordinary temptations a matter of despair. Thus
the scheme falls to the ground.  
  
  
  Thus baffled in the two schemes mentioned above, the
<!-- Leaf 60, Page: 50 -->
Reveshould be said of the poor ryot living upon the - sweat of his
brow,' and paying all manner of taxes ?


There are a few general considerations to which it is, I
think, necessary to allude, even briefly, before closing this paper.


First, that the present system of well-assessment is a positive
bar to improvement in production or increased cultivation in
Gujarat. Except in Punch Mahals, the limit of cultivation has
been reached in most of the districts of the Province. This being
so, there is only one remedy of making the land capable of
returning increased produce, viz., by turning the present dry
crop lands into irrigated lands, wherever it is possible to do so by
affording facilities for irrigation. That many lands which at
present are dry-crop are capable of being converted into irrigated
lands admits of no doubt whatever. Wherever the old wells
exist, and are at present in a fallen condition, the cultivator or
the owner would not go to the expense of putting them to repairs
simply because of the assessment. ■ He would rather find it
to his interest to dig a new well rather than put the old one to
repairs. Even in constructing a new well, he is afraid lest he
should be subjected to an imposition of the cess, notwithstanding
that there is a legal provision to prevent that imposition in future.


Secondly, in his celebrated Famine Report, Col. Baird Smith
observes (para. 101 of the Report) that to keep an agricultural
people above want in anydistrict under all vicissitudes, it is
necessary that one-third at least of the land under plough should
be supplied with the means of irrigation. Referring to this
observation, Major Prescott asks, in connection with a highly
cultivated district, " Now, what is the present position of Neriad, in
this respect, the most highly irrigate! talooka in this province?"
And he answers, that "of a cultivated area of 128,219 acres,
11,930 only, or a little over 9 per cent (Government and alienated
inclusive) is irrigated. Little less than one-tenth of the whole
available area." He further observes :—" We draw all we can
out of Gujarat, do not expend one shilling in works of irrigation
and tax wells besides. I cannot think that is the way to be
forearmed for the evil hour, which may come when we least expect
it. I am well aware we cannot abandon this source of revenue,
<!-- Leaf 24, Page: 14 -->
\"he afterwards filled up for Rs. 5,427, besides the gaumkhurch,
\"and to raise this amount, although the patels paid phalani of
•' Rs. 86 per anna, and sold a quantity of mujmoon land, they
\"were obliged to borrow Rs. 700 of a soukar.'


The Bhagdari tenure, however, survived the Maratha rule.
To meet the unreasonable and ever-increasing demands of the
Maratha Government, the proprietors found out the Nurwa
system. A principle of joint responsibility was introduced, by which
the whole proprietary body in a Nurwadari village held itself
answerable for the due payment of the oodhur jummabundy, or
lump sum, at which it was assessed. The amount payable
breach Bhagdar was in proportion to the extent of the lands which
comprised his share. If any of the principal proprietors failed to
pay his share of the revenue, the entire body had to make up the
amount, each member contributing his quota in proportion to his
share of land. Individually, each principal Bhagdar was not
only responsible for the. amount due on account of his own share,
but also for what was due from his peta bhagdars or sub-sharers.
If any of these sub-sharers failed to meet his demand, his
principal Bhagdar,—called Muttadar,—had to make up his deficit. At
the same time, the land in the possession of the sub-sharer
reverted to the Muttadar. So, also, in the case of the principal
Muttadar whose land reverted to the whole proprietary body in case
of his failure. On the Muttadars lay the direct responsibility of
payment to the State. They collected the revenue, aud, in this
capacity, were known as the Oogratdars, or revenue collectors.
They first collected the rents of the mujmoon or common lands,
the cesses fluctuating or permanent, the produce of fruit tries,
and the salamis, or quit-rents, on alienated lands. These
collections went to pay the jummabundy, the deficiency in the amount
being made up by a phalani or distribution of the sum over the
whole proprietary body in proportion to its respective shares.


This was the Nurwa system. That the Bhagdars had been
able to retain the management of their lands in spite of the new
and unreasonable demands of the Maratha rulers, especially,
when the direct payers—the peasantry—broke down, shows that
the system had some merits of its own. One reason why it
<!-- Leaf 44, Page: 34 -->
surdoes not follow that the British Government should therefore
perpetuate it, after being once conscious of the mistake. Any
Government is bound to rectify the mistakes of its predecessors, far
more so an enlightened Government like the British. Though
adhering to the main principles of the native revenue system, it
has always departed from it whenever it was found convenient
to do so without raising an alarm thereby. Take the instance
of the Nurwa tenure itself. Under the old Nurwa system, the
amount received on account of Mujmoon lands was always
deducted from the gross amount payable by the village
community, and the remainder was distributed over the entire body
of the Nurwadars, who had to pay according to the shares
respectively held by them. In the revised settlement, however,
Government has, contrary to the spirit of the Nurwa tenure,
thought fit to appropriate the assessment on Mujmoon lands to
itself, leaving the Nurwadars to make up the amount without
the deduction usually allowed under the native rule. When this
deviation from the practice has been slurred over, is it too much
to urge upon it the necessity of deviating from the practice of the
native rule in respect of the levy ofa cess on irrigated lands?
But the question rests on the supposition, that such a charge was
made on irrigated lands under the Nurwa system. This,
however, as we have shewn above, has no foundation in fact.


But it would be doing an injustice to the British
Government to deny that whenever a clear ease of injustice is brought to
light, Government has deemed it its duty to rectify it. The
recent assessment of the Ir.dapoor Talooka in the Poona
Collectorate may be cited as an instance. In its Resolution in the
Revenue Department No. 1211, dated 27th March 1868,* the
Government of Bombay has enunciated the following views of
its policy on well-assessment: —


\"In regard to special taxation of wells, it is said with truth
\"that water is, like mineral wealth, fairly taxable by the
land" lord when used by the tenant. His Excellency in Council,
\"however, considers that the first principle of its taxation should

<!-- Leaf 95, Page: 85 -->
An argument must have a point d'appui of premises common to both
sides to argue from. But your correspondent is so ill-informed of
revenue affairs as to render it impossible to discuss them with him.


On other accounts besides my immediate object, it is right to remind
people of a great fundamental principle appertaining to the land of this
country, that all of it is, or was, once Imperial property. However much
this may be just now misunderstood, it is still nevertheless true, and a
simple but very important fact. The word " alienated," as applied to
land, is nicely indicative of the principle. For although the Government
may have alienated its rights as a landlord, temporarily or for ever, the
essence of the connection of Indian land, with its Government, has always
been from time immemorial, that all the land is a Government estate.
No doubt objectors to the Bill for City Surveys now before the
Legislative Council would cavil at this enunciation, but that would not
disturb the fact.


Now as to its applicability to what I have to say. Before,
the revenue Survey came into operation, land was assessed periodically,
usually yearly. But says the Preamble of Act I of 1868, " Whereas

a moderate assessment of land revenue is equally conducive to the
interests of Government, and the well-being of its subjects; and whereas
it has been, and is the desire of Government to equalise assessments,
to ascertain and settle the obligations, and to record the rights, interests,
and privileges of persons and classes owning and occupying land," &c.
And in pursuance of the provisions of the enactment, the Neriad
settlement was made. As to the manner in which it was carried out, you
could not afford me space for even a very sketchy precis of the
voluminous correspondence in which officers, thoroughly familiar with the duty
they had to do, discussed with a punctilious regard for the welfare of tho
ryot, that is distinctive of the revenue survey system and its officers,
every point of the settlement, so as to make it fair and equable in its
bearing on all interests affected by it, and without a thought of
introducing a measure framed merely to increase Government revenue, at the
expense of the ryot, which is so far from being a part of the revenue
survey system, that the very essence of it is to lower rates so as to
increase the area of cultivation, and so add to revenue by inducing
cultivation of waBte lands at the low prices.


If your correspondent had acquainted himself with this, and if he had
taken pains to inform himself properly of what he was writing about,
say, by the one-hundredth part of the labour which the officers entrusted
with making tbe settlement went through, he might, it is true, have
stumbled upon facts from which he has arrived at erroneous conclusions;
but if he had, in course of continuing his labours, ho would have como
to know how misleading facts sometimes are when considered alone.
<!-- Leaf 40, Page: 30 -->
\"never been assessed before, for the Nurwadari rentals were
'-originally made up of the estimated value of the produce of
\"lands improved as well as unimproved, so that lands watered
\"from these old wells were valued according to garden-crop
\"rates. This was not done by the British Government, who
\"simply continued the system handed down to them from native
\"rulers, and were thus in the position of a landlord inheriting an
\"improved estate, for the improvements effected in which in
\"former times the tenants had already received full
considera" tion. If wrong was done in taxing irrigated lands in the first
\"instance, it is a very quixotic idea to maintain that the British
\"Government is bound to go back and redress what was done
■' by its predecessors."


With every deference due to the views of the writer of the
above paragraph, we cannot help entering our protest in respect
of the statements made above.


The apology thus put forward on behalf of Government for
the levy of rates on old wells rests on four distinct grounds, viz.:—  
  
  
  1st.—That such rates were levied under the native rule.


2ndly.—That the British Government have, in the revised
settlement, and, especially, in the case of assessment on wells, simply
followed out the revenue system of the native rulers.


3rdly.—That well-owners on whose lands the rates are at
present charged, have received ample consideration for their
improvements in former times.


4thly.—That if any wrong was committed in the present levy
of a well-cess, the British Government is not bound to redress
it, since it has simply followed the system of the native rulers.


We have now to enquire how far each of these statements is
supported by the actual circumstances of the country. For
proof of the first proposition we are referred back to the mode
in which the Nurwadari settlement was carried out under the
native rule, where, it is alleged, ' the Nurwadari rentals were
made up of the estimated value of the produce of lands improved
as well as unimproved, so that lands watered from these old
wells were valued according to garden-crop rates.' In the
preceding article on land tenures in Gujarat I have attempted
<!-- Leaf 113, Page: 103 -->
of the Gutkool holdings of the Deccan and Oopree of Gujarat, where
tbe holders were mere tenants at will of Government; or partially, as in
that of the Miras of the Deccan and Nurwa of Gujarat, where the
ownership was shared between the state and the ryot. In either case,
Government had a right, which up to the present time has never been
questioned under either Native or British rule, to participate in the
profits of improvements made by the tenant's capital. This right of
course rests on the very same grounds as the right of a landlord to levy
rent at all. A tenant might argue that unless he, by the outlay of his
capital, ploughed and sowed his dry-crop laud, it would pay the landlord
nothing, and therefore that the landlord should let him have it for
nothing. The answer is obviously that the land is the landlord's and the rent
is what the privilege of ploughing and sowing it is worth. Just so with
the construction of wells. No one forced the tenant to make his well; he
did so because he thought that the share of its profits which would fall to
him after paying his landlord, the State, an increased rent, would
remunerate him for the outlay. Iu the present case, according to their own
showing, the tenants made the wells on certain conditions, viz., that for
thirty years they should pay dry-crop rates only for the lands irrigated
from them, and afterwards garden rates; and they now complain of
being held to their agreement, and Native Opinion thinks that
Government is bound to cancel it, simply because the State has conferred as a
free gift upon other persons, those who make wells after the introduction
of the settlement, perpetual exemption from increase of assessment on
that account. Government conceded this from a political motive, viz., to
induce persons by the prospect of the whole profits to invest money in
improving their lands who might not be induced to do so by the prospect of
a share only of the profits. But this reason surely does not apply to cases
where the money has been already invested, and where by the very fact
of their having made the wells, the tenants have allowed that the terms
already offered them, gave them sufficient inducement to do so.


The question is in no way complicated by the fact that the lands of
Neriad are held on Nurwa tenure, for no one has ever pretended that this
tenure conveys any exemption from assessment. Nor ia it the question
whether the garden rates imposed by the survey are too high, but
whether Government has a right to levy extra rates at all. As I know
that the irrigated lands of Neriad are sometimes sublet for as much as
Rs. 50 per acre, while the survey assessment is, I suppose, Rs. 10 or Rs. 12
per acre, it would seem that the rates leave sufficient margin of profit to
the proprietor. But to get rid of the apparent anomaly of some
Government lands paying extra assessment and others not, the holders have
been given the option of redeeming, once for all, that extra assessment;
and notwithstanding that Native Opinion thinks this absurd, I humbly
venture to believe that it is the best thing they can do.

Considering the various circumstances affecting the produce of

each of these talookas, such as soil, climate, the proximity or
remoteness of accessible markets, and above all, the facilities for
carrying off the produce afforded by the Bombay and Baroda
Railway running through the heart of the zilla, it is but fair
to say that the rates of assessment are in due proportion to the
advantages enjoyed. They cannot be said to press very heavily
upon the cultivators. The villages in the talooka at the head
of the above fist (Neriad), and those in their immediate
neighbourhood belonging to H. H. the Gaekwar, produce
the finest tobacco in the whole of Gujarat, nay, of India.
Besides its large local consumption, the Neriad and Mehelava
tobacco is exported from Gujarat in abundant quantities to
Bombay, Malwa, Indore, Central India, Berars, and even to

Aden and Muscat. It is rich and strong in flavour, but owing
to defects in the method of curing and other treatment, the
leaves, as soon as they get dry, become very brittle, and do not
admit of being folded into, and otherwise made suitable for,
cheroots. These defects in the modes of treatment and curing
are capable of being easily remedied, provided the ryot be taught

  INTRODUCTORY NOTE.


A revision of Land Settlement, conducted mainly in
accordance with the principles laid down by Sir George Wingate in the
celebrated Joint Report of 1847 and in Act I. of 1865, has been
effected throughout the greater portion of Gujarat Proper. But it is much
to be regretted that the Reports of the Revenue Survey Department
on the districts long settled have not yet seen light. From the
volume on the Kaira Zilla, issued among the Selections from the
Records of the Bombay Government, it would appear that such reports
embrace not merely the usual details of land survey, but a valuable
body of authentic information concerning the physical features of the
districts, the character of the soil, its productions, the nature of
its land tenures, and the obstacles which retard the development of its
natural resources. In the following pages the writer has attempted to
review such points in the revision of the Land Settlement of the Kaira
Zilla as appeared to him to require prominent attention. The settlement,
he is glad to observe, has, upon the whole, given satisfaction to those who
are immediately affected by it, except in certain points as have been
noticed in the last two articles. The extra assessment on wells
especially is looked upon as a real grievance by the owners of well
property in the Kaira Zilla. When closely looked into, it would
appear to be utterly indefensible, on any theory of rent, whether
viewed as a charge on capital, which it really is, or in the light of a
tax on improvements,—a tax, be it remembered, which has been legally
removed for all future time on wells constructed during the currency
of the thirty years' leases, or after their expiry. Moreover, the
revenue now derived from it is at best precarious, and likely to be
extinguished on the expiry of the current leases. It is only to be
hoped that the suffering well-owners will have justice done to them
<!-- Leaf 49, Page: 39 -->
would be looked upon by the Government of India as the " price
of the redemption of a certain portion of the Imperial land
revenue," and would not consequently be allowed to be expended
for local improvements as suggested by Mr. Pedder, expresses
great doubts as to what would be thought of the measure by the
people of Gujarat affected by it. The people are naturally at
a loss to understand what justifiable basis there can be for a
commutation of the cess, especially, when the levy of the cess on
wells brought into existence by their private enterprise is at
best considered as a piece of zoolum or mere force. Major
Prescott goes on to observe:—


\"Well-assessment, however moderate it may be, is the least popular
of imposts upou land. It is paid because proprietary right is secured
and maintained by its payments, and occupiers would gladly relieve
themselves of the liability iu the manner proposed if they could be convinced
that it is a really equitable arrangement as regards themselves as well as
the State. We may try to convince them that they are simply redeeming
a portion of the dues of the State, but they will think—

\"1st.—That they are purchasing a right which they have already bought
by the expenditure of their capital and labour on Government property,
for the idea ot the natives of Gujarat is, that he who sinks a well has
given something to the State; aud,

\"2ud.—That they are purchasing a very precarious tenure in a well
which may fall in any day, a few days after purchase even, thus leaving
them minus the meaus of building a new well, having expended their
means in buying the perpetual right iu the old one."


The first of the two arguments put forward by or on behalf
of the well-owners, seems to be deserving of much greater
attention than that which it has yet received. It carries us to the
consideration of the abstract questions :—1st, whether in any
land owned by Government, the State, if landlord, has any right
to levy a tax or royalty on water rendered accessible to the use
of man by the labour and capital expended over it by the
cultivator ? and, 2ndly, if so, how far does that right extend ?


First, then, with regard to the right of Government, it has
been held by no less an authority than Sir G. Wingate, that the
State, as landlord, has a right to claim a royalty on the water
of the wells sunk into Government lands. Sir George gives his
reason as follows :—
\"The application of the cultivator's capital to the construction of a
new well or the repair of an old one does not create water for irrigation
<!-- Leaf 28, Page: 18 -->
  
  IV.
THE REVISED SETTLEMENT.


The first question in connection with the revision of the
settlement of the Kaira zilla was, Should the existing Nurwadari
system of tenure be retained or replaced by the Survey System ?
There were certainly many things to be said in favour of the
village system. The ryots and the Nurwadars had clung to it from
time immemorial, and had thus come to look upon it as an
established institution—an institution which had survived the various
political changes in the country. Moreover, the working out of
it did not at all clash with the principles of the revised settlement
as laid down in the Joint Report. Something more was therefore
required to carry out a radical change in the land system of a
whole province, than the mere desire of revenue officers to
assimilate all tenures to one form. On a due consideration of the
various points, pro and con, the Settlement Officer recommended
that it was far more prudent, looking equally to the interests of
Government as well as to those of the ryots, to retain the
Nurwa tenure. The chief reasons advanced were—


First, that in case the existing tenure was superseded by the
Survey system, such an act would be viewed with alarm by the
Nurwadars, and great discontent on their part would be the result.


Secondly, that individual Nurwadars having alienated portions
of their lands, such portions, hitherto held as rent-free, will bear
a full assessment under the new Survey,—another source of
considerable bickering on the part of the proprietary body.


Thirdly, that Government would suffer an immediate loss of
revenue, inasmuch as the new Survey would set free waste lands
which had hitherto been included in the lump assessment, but
which under the new Survey would pay no assessment, at least,
not for some time to come.


For these and other reasons, Government sanctioned the
retention of the Nurwa, to the great satisfaction of the proprietary
body, who looked upon any innovation in their existing system
with considerable anxiety. A few modifications were, however,
<!-- Leaf 25, Page: 15 -->
vived the Maratha oppression was that the increased demand
of the State was distributed over a large number of sharers
and sub-sharers, which contributed greatly to lighten the
burden. Another feature of the system, as it obtained under
the Maratha rule, was the liberty each Nurwadar had of
selling or mortgaging his land and raising money thereby. In
times of distress or in bad years, the Narwadar had often recourse
to this step, which afforded him no small relief. This explains
the alienation of considerable tracts of land in the Kaira zilla—•
lands known as Nurwa Barkhali, Nurwa Vechania, and
Guranea. The Nurwadars also alienated lands in charity
(dlwmddd) to Brahmans, Bhats, Charuns, and other mendicants.
Such lands are known as pasaeta lands in Kaira zilla, and
wuzeefa in Broach. There were alienations also on account of
service done to Nurwadars. These are still known as chakariat
lands. All these had to be finally settled during the revised

survey.


Between the years 1800 and 1817 A.C., nearly the whole of
Gujarat passed into the hands of the British Government, partly
{empty}.by right of conquest, and partly by cessions from the Peshwa
and the Gaekwar under the treaty of Bassein. At the
commencement of the British rule, the old revenue management
of the territories was of course adhered to. This was, however,
shortly found to be unsuitable. But before introducing any
change of a permanent character into the existing revenue system,
it was found necessary to know the customs and usages of the
country, the rights and privileges of the landed classes,—from the
Kunbi cultivating his land on a tenancy-at-will to the talookdar
—the lord of many thousand acres of land. All this was a work
of time, but it evinces no small amount of political sagacity and
practical wisdom on the part of the authorities of the time
to find that the chief attention of the district officers was then
directed towards collecting information from all available sources
—information likely to throw light on the past fiscal and political
history and present condition of the people. The materials thus
collected formed the basis of future procedure in the revenue and
political management of the country.
<!-- Leaf 72, Page: 62 -->

{empty}2. The necessity for a change of system has become apparent in
Gujarat, where no mode that has hitherto been devised for taxing lands
irrigated from wells is free from the objections of want of simplicity,
liability to evasion, and inequality of incidence.
{empty}3. On this subject Captain Prescott,

No. 548 dated 1st December 1864- Superintendent of Survey, Gujarat, reports
as follows :—  
  
  
  Paragraph 5.
Paragraph 8 (with note) to end of paragraph 13th.


{empty}4. I think it must be admitted that the taxation of wells not
constructed by the State is a deviation from the broad principles of the
Bombay Survey. All wells built hereafter by individuals will be free
from taxation : it seems hard that wells similarly built by individuals,
but before the advent of the Survey, should be placed at a disadvantage
and subjected to heavier taxation for no reason save that their owners
were in advance of their neighbours in employing their capital in
agriculture.


{empty}5. On the other hand, it is quite consistent with the principles of the
Survey that if the inherent qualities of the soil be such that water is
produced by digging for it within a few feet of the surface, this
capability should be taxed as well as other elements of fertility.


{empty}6. The whole of the revenue from lands irrigated from wells in
Gujarat and Khandeish may easily be made good by a very slight
enhancement of the rate on all lands capable of producing water.


{empty}7. There is land, as in Sowda in Khandeish, from which water may
be obtained, but only by digging to the depth of 80 or 90 feet. Such
land should not be considered as having a natural water capability, and
the owner should be free to enjoy untaxed the results of his labour and
expenditure of capital in raising water.


{empty}8. I would limit the depth to 60 feet or to 30 feet according as the
water is sweet or salt. A very slight addition to the rates on all lands
in which water is obtainable within these depths will more than
compensate Government for the loss of revenue from wells, and I am sure
that the removal of well assessment will be universally popular and tend
more than any other measure that could be devised to give the ryots
confidence and induce the building of new wells.


{empty}9. I have directed Captain Prescott and Mr. Davidson in introducing
the revision of assessment during the current season to adopt this new
system experimentally, and I have little doubt of the result.


10. To these proceedings I have now to request the sanction of
Government.  
  
  
  I have the honour, &c,

purely upon the whim or caprice of the classing officer, who is
guided in his standard of the fairness of the rates by the fact of the
ryots complaining against it or otherwise. If the owners of the
wells offer a stubborn resistance to pay the proposed rate, it is
reduced to a figure which they will be able to bear. Thus the
ability of the payer of a particular rate is the guiding principle
in deciding upon that rate. If the ryot should be so stupid, or
so negligent of his interest, as to accept of the rate proposed to
be levied by the classer, that settles the matter at once. Many
owners have thus fallen victims to the want of any principle in
fixing the rate.


Thirdly, Inequality of assessment. This is a natural
consequence of any arbitrary system of taxation, and much more so
in the case of well assessment. How this takes place will
appear from the following considerations.


In Gujarat it often happens that a well is the joint property
of two or three persons. Of these one may have lent his
capital, another his labour in digging and constructing it, and a
third materials to work with. In the case of such a well,
whereas the joint sharers have each a right to draw water, there
are other persons who have their land mid er the well, but have
no right to water from it. The latter in fact have not the
remotest interest or concern in the water, and yet because
their land is so situated, it is considered to possess a
capacity of being watered, and for this capacity the land, is cltarged
with a heavy bagayut kussur, an oppressive well-tax ! Thus let the
owner of the well make use of the well-water or not, because
there is a remote contingency of his using the water, and that
too, mind, by paying a piawa, this land is made to bear the tax !


What then have the apologists of this measure to say ? The
Survey Department has, so far as we know, little to urge in
favor of it beyond its convenience to settling officers in cases
where wells fall off, and when it becomes imperative upon them to
strike off the item from the amount of land assessment payable
by the cultivator. In such cases it would be a long and tedious
process to again go over the different calculations by which the
amount of cess was determined at the time of the settlement. But
<!-- Leaf 69, Page: 59 -->
late Jeytulpoor pergunnah, separate garden rates were imposed directly
upon lands watered from wells, and to ascertain the real amount of well
assessment in these districts the dry-crop assessment of each bagayut
field must be calculated and deducted from the present bagayut
assessment, the difference being the kussur. This would be a troublesome
business, but it would, I think, be easier and cheaper to do it once for all,
than as at present, to have to do it by degrees, as the wells fall in. In
Dholka, and the other districts in which the plan of a rate on each bag
actually used to lift the water was adopted, the rate of purchase might
be fixed with reference to the average actual realisations from each well
since the introduction of the Survey settlement.


{empty}6. If you approve of these suggestions, I would recommend that the
plan be tried as an experiment in one talooka, first, say Muhoonda, in
which there will be no difficulty in ascertaining the amount of kussur.


{empty}7. I have talked this matter over with the Acting Collector of Kaira
who fully agrees with what I have proposed above.

In returning the correspondence which accompanied the Officiating
Chief Secretary's Memorandum No. 1454, of 6th instant, the undersigned
has the honour to state that the expenditure therein alluded to will have
to be provided for in the Budget, and exhibited in the accounts of the

of bagayut kussur. we have to go through all the calculations as in the
example given in paragraph 19.

\"The settling officer decides on an examination of each district or
group of villages, how many acres a one-koss well working a certain
number of hours will on an average irrigate, and the rate of bagayut
assessment which it will be proper to impose, and from this a table is
drawn out. Thus if it is found that a well working 9 hours can irrigate
on an average 4 acres, and one working 6 hours 2£ acres, and that the
proper rates, in addition to the dry-crop assessment, will be, for a sweet
well Rs. 5, for a brackish ope Rs. 3, and for a salt one Rs. 2 per acre.
The table would be in the following form :—


\"23. With the aid of this table, it is as easy for the settling officer to
fix the bagayut assessment for a whole district, as according to the former
system to fix that of a single large village. It is easy when the total
assessment on the well has been ascertained to distribute the amount
over all the fields watered by it, in proportion to the share of each holder.
If there is any doubt about the shares, we can postpone the distribution
till the jummabundy, and then ascertaining the facts from the people who
are present, fill in the figures iu 10 minutes, the Survey registers being
complete, as far as the calculation of the dry-crop rates is concerned.
The correction of errors is also extremely simple, e.g., at the jummabundy
of Oomret talooka Thasra, we found that the garden rates which I had
originally imposed were too low, and decided upon raising them J, which
was immediately done by adding 8 annas to every rupee of kussur in the
Register. Under the old system, this would have involved the
recalculation of the rates, and would have been very troublesome. If after the
settlement a well falls in, the Collector has only to strike out the kussur,
and if as sometimes happens, a cultivator should wish to resign one of
his bagayut fields, but to retain his well, the kussur can be immediately
transferred to whatever field he may point out.


\"24. There is another advantage in this system. It sometimes
occurs ii On arat, that a Government well belongs to a person who has
no land under it. In this case we can ehter the holder of the well as a

<!-- Leaf 64, Page: 54 -->

{empty}6. The Superintendent is very respectfully of opinion that the State
need not lose anything by dispensing altogether with the cess on pucka
wells—in Gujarat—at future settlements.


{empty}7. Mr. Pedder, in paragraph 4, of his letter points out how small the
amount of revenue, derived from wells, in Muhoonda is, as compared with
the total assessment. The full assessment of Government lands amounts
to Rs. 220,795, the well kussur, to Rs. 4,571, which is not quite 4 pies in
the Rupee. Surely this insignificant amount might have been allowed
for in the dry-crop maximum rates without one single individual
cultivator being a bit the wiser, and without a tittle of injustice or sacrifice
of principle; for it is certainly quite as fair and reasonable to bear in
mind, when grouping the villages and fixing the rates of a district, that
good water is almost everywhere procurable in the alluvial soil of Gujarat
at from 20 to 30 feet below the surface, as that there are good markets,
and facilities for the transport of produce. In Muhoonda, for example,
the difference of 4 pies in a Rupee, in the average rates, would have been
a sum entirely inappreciable in an individual's assessment.


{empty}8. Water in the soil—and very close to the surface—is a gift of
nature almost peculiar to the province of Gujarat. It ought therefore to
be considered ae one of the fertilising elements of the soil, and its value
incorporated and included in the soil assessment whenever it is practicable.


{empty}9. As a case in point the Superintendent may mention that he is, at
present, engaged in framing a scale for the classification of the rich
sugar-cane lands—in the western portion of the southern districts of
Surat—which are watered indiscriminately from pucka and kucha wells.
Pucka and kucha wells are found side by side.


10. A pucka well lasting 70 or 80 years costs from 45 to 60 Rupees,
a kucha well from 5 to 8 Rupees per annum. It is, consequently, cheaper
in the end to sink a pucka well, at once; for the interest of Rs. 60 at
12 per cent, per annum is less than the yearly cost of a kucha well.


11. Now there are only two ways of assessing land like this, one by
putting a rate on every bag used to lift water, (whether taken from a
pucka or kucha well) in addition to the soil rate. The other by putting
the full assessment—whatever it may be—on the soil, at once.


12. The latter is the right way, for the former besides being
objectionable in every respect would be evaded to a certainty.0 Now in land
like this it would manifestly be absurd to attempt a well assessment or to
draw any distinction between pucka and kucha wells. A good
classification will show every acre of land having this peculiar advantage, and a

* In Dholka wells built for four cosses, capable of watering, say 16 acres of land,
and which it was supposed would pay 4 bag rates, work one koss onl3' for 21 hours,
instead of 4 kosses for 6 hours, and by this contrivance evade the full tax, paying fur
one bag instead of four.
<!-- Leaf 38, Page: 28 -->
work to go through. They have to determine the dry-crop rates
of assessment, not only on each field, but also general rates
for different classes of soils, and it must be mentioned that
these rates are arrived at generally after a due consideration
of the circumstances affecting the soil of a district, its climate,
the proximity or remoteness of accessible markets, the prices
of food prevalent during the previous ten or twenty years, and
other facts bearing upon its prosperity.


In the districts of Gujarat, where the revised settlement of land
has been conducted as above, the measure has upon the whole
been met with tolerable satisfaction except in respect of one
important subject, and that is the assessment of wells.


Wherever in Gujarat, as mentioned above, wells have been
found to exist at the time of the revised settlement, they have
been carefully noted, the qualities of their water classed, and the
fields in which they are found have an extra cess levied on them,
over and above the dry-crop rates to which they would be
liable, had the wells no existence at all. This has given rise to
general dissatisfaction among the cultivating classes of Gujarat,
from the fact that the wells were never the property of the
State, in fact, the State never contributed a farthing towards
their construction, although the lands in which such wells were
found to exist belonged to Government. The injustice of this
levy is further heightened from the circumstance that new
wells constructed after the introduction of the revised rates of
settlements are exempted from all future assessment.


There are thus two questions involved in this controversy,
one relating to the assessment of old wells found at tliQ period
of the revised settlement, and the other having reference to the
levy ofa water rate on new wells, that is to say, those constructed
after the introduction of the settlement rates. With respect to
assessjng new wells, Government has laid down a just, broad,
and liberal principle that no improvements on land shall hereafter
be taxed, or shall ever enter as elements of taxation in a revision
of land settlement hereafter. The principle is thus laid down in
Section XXX. of Act I. of 1865 :—  
  
  
  " It shall be lawful for the Governor in Council to direct at any time

facts and truthfulness. But who is to get at it ? No one, perhaps,
except the Collector of the zilla or his Assistant. For those
who may be interested in the subject or competent to do justice
to it, tho records of Government may as well lie for years—a
prey to white ants—for any good they do. The policy of
secrecy must give way to that of free access, especially in the
case of public documents—before we gee a Dr. Hunter of this
Presidency to work them up into something worthy of a rural
history of Gujarat.


As in other parts of India, so in Gujarat there has existed
from time immemorial an institution called the village
community. Though time and circumstance have done much to
modify it, yet to this day in many of its existing ramifications,
it exhibits all its essential features. This village community
was of two kinds. In its simplest form it existed where
all the lands of a village were held direct from the Raja or
owner of the village. Here each man cultivated his own plot
of ground and paid rent to the Raja. The cultivator's right to
his land consisted in the understanding that he was not to be
ousted out of his possession so long as he continued to pay to
the Raja his rent, of which the amount, though generally fixed
by custom, often varied according to the caprices of the ruler or
the exigencies of the State. This species of tenure is found in
most parts of Gujarat, and Government has met with little
difficulty in making a settlement of the same.


The other species of village community, abundantly met with
in Churotur or Western portion of the Kaira Zilla, in Broach,
and the Surat Attavesy, consisted originally of a body or bodies
of cultivating castes such as Koonbies in the Kaira zilla,
Koonbies and Borahs in Broach, and Bhatellas and Rajpoots in the
Surat Collectorate. They fixed upon a certain site in a particular
part of a zilla, and founded a village thereon by settling
themselves and inviting others to join them. Leaving a certain
portion to be held in common or mujmoon to be given to their
servants and others as an inducement to come and settle there, they
divided the remainder of the lands of the village into large equal
shares. They dug the village tank, built the village temple, laid

  His Excellency the Honourable the Governor in Council,  
  
  
  Bombay.


Sir,—I have considered in Council the Despatch from your Excellency
iu Council numbered 11, and dated the 12th May last, informing me,
with reference to paragraph 3 of my despatch of the 9th of March last,
<!-- Leaf 68, Page: 58 -->
remitted by the time curient Survey leases expire, and that nearly the
whole of them wiil have been struck off before the end of the next
leases. By Section XXX. of the Survey Act no extra assessment will be
imposed under a fresh survey lease ou account of new wells constructed
at the expense of landholders, and it is therefore evident that in the
course of the next thirty or forty years revenue derived from wells will
almost entirely disappear, a result which, as suggested in the 1st
paragraph of the Revenue Commissioner's reply to the Acting Collector of
Kaira, is highly desirable.


{empty}4. It seems to me well worthy of consideration whether this result
may not with great advantage be hastened by selling the liability to pay
well assessment to the proprietors of the wells, at a certain number of
years' purchase. I think that the owners of the wells, who are mostly
substantial cultivators, would gladly pay a fair sum to get rid of the Well
assessment, (which, when they themselves, or their ancestors, have
constructed the wells, they all look upon as an unfair impost,) if a moderate
time, say two years, is given them to pay the amount in instalments, and
I am sure the measure would be beneficial to Government. The amount
of annual revenue to be immediately sacrificed is small compared with
the remainder of the assessment, while the sum immediately realised
might now be expended to great advantage by being thrown into the
local funds, and spent upon the improvements of the roads, tanks,
drainage, &c, of the district—e. g. the well assessment on
Government lands in the Muhoonda pergunnah amounts to Rs. 4,571 only,
or little more than 2 per cent, of the total assessment of Government
lands in that district (Rs. 2,20,795), and this sum, as I have shown
above, will diminish every year. By selling the right to levy this at
fifteen years' purchase, Rs. 68,565 would be realised, a sum more than
sufficient to build the long required bridge over the Siri river on the
Neriad and Kupperwunj road. It is worth considering, too, that by this
measure the disputes, inquiries, and correspondence which are
continually arising out of the troublesome subject of well assessment will be
altogether got rid of.


{empty}5. In Muhoonda, Thasra, and Kupperwunj, and in all districts
remaining for settlement in which the new system of bagayut assessment
by means of a kussur has been, or will be, fully applied, there will not be
the slightest difficulty in at once ascertaining the amount of kussur payable
on account of each well and by each sharer in it. In Prantej, and in the
portion of Mehmoodabad which formed the late Matur pergunnah, the
kussur system was applied to garden lands, but the extra assessment on
account of wells irrigating rice lands was included iu the direct
assessment on the soil, and there would consequently be some little difficulty
in ascertaining the amount of the well assessment in such cases. Iu
Duskrohie, and the portion of Mehmoodabad which was comprised in the
<!-- Leaf 89, Page: 79 -->
been raised. The result, however, appears to be that the correctness of
the theory is admitted, but difficulties are raised in respect to the
practical application of the principle.


{empty}4. These difficulties do not everywhere exist. As an instance it may
be noted that Major Francis has introduced a similar system into the
district of Kundiara in Sind. In the Bhatta lands of Gujarat the
principle has also been successfully adopted by Captain Prescott and Mr.
Pedder. The plan is certainly practicable where the lands in which wells
may be dug are in tracts of considerable extent. Where the well
assessment is likely to disappear altogether in a short time, as in some of the
districts of Gujarat, or where it is likely to fall off owing to the small
profits of such cultivation as compared with-dry crop cultivation, it is surely
better to devise and adopt some system for taxing the irrigable quality
of the land. This need not be by the general imposition of additional
assessment on all lands; it would naturally fall only on the best lands
which are ordinarily those in which such capabilities are found. It may
in some places be necessary to have the portion of the village lands to
which such extra assessment would be applicable noted and recorded by
the Assistant iu charge of classing duties; and His Excellency in
Council does not think that the task would ordinarily be as difficult a3 the
work of fixing again rates for garden lands under the present system,
On the other hand, there are doubtless districts in which it would be
difficult to carry out the taxation of the water producing powers of the
lands sufficiently to compensate for the abandonment of the present
system. But these exceptions should not prevent the adoption of a more
correct Bystem wherever it is practicable.


{empty}5. Captain Prescott has framed a plan for working out an application
of the principle. He may be permitted to try this in any district in
which it may be found appropriate, and the result will appear in the
Settlement Report. It will be sufficient for Government to record an
opinion that the principle should be the basis of settlement whenever the
Superintendent can safely and conveniently apply it. There can be no
greater inducement to the digging of wells than the exemption of all
wells from assessment. Of course, this exemption could not affect
retrospectively assessment now being levied, but whenever a revision takes
place, the Survey Commissioners and Superintendents should consider
whether the special rates imposed on existing wells may not be got rid
of without a great sacrifice of revenue.

—the money lender—will not for a moment grudge him a loan,
whereas the Kunbi will be required to furnish a valuable
security before he can raise money, the general impression
being that the Patidar being a respectable man is sure to pay
his debts. He will sell everything he possesses to satisfy hi8
creditors rather than loose his abroo. Then, again, while widow
marriage is freely allowed among Kunbis, it does not obtain
among Patidars, which is considered a point of social
superiority, though the prohibition is of modern origin. The
Patidar belongs to the lewa division of the Kunbi caste,
while the common Kunbi belongs to what is called the kudwa
division of the Kunbis—two important distinctions of the same
caste, caused by the difference of social status. In other
respects, the two classes have close intercommunication.


The relation in which the village community of the two-fold
form described above stood with government was as follows.
The primary method of meeting the demands of the State was to
divide the produce, government taking generally a third share,
the remaining two-thirds being left to the cultivator. In
nurwadari villages, a similar amount having been obtained from
the holders of mujmoon lands, the remainder was paid by the
nurwadars according to their respective shares. This was called
the bhagbuttai or division of produce system. It obtains to this
day among the Native States in Gujarat, Kattyawar, and, I
believe, in other parts of India. It is true that in principle the
system seems fair enough, and when we look round to the effect
of it in having recently enriched almost all Native States on this
side of India, we cannot be blind to its beneficial results in
times when the value of produce stands high. It has freed the
Talookdars of Ahmedabad from the mire of debt into which they
were sunk. It has made many small principalities in
Kattyawar independent of the soukar under whose clutches they were
groaning, and it has poured wealth into the treasuries of large
Native States which has proved a source of additional strength
to them. The staple produce of those States, small or great,
being cotton—the value of which depended upon foreign demand
—all the produce which fell to the share of the States realized

in the interest of Government as well as of the public. They
tend much to clear up many of the erroneous impressions that
prevail in the public mind respecting its land policy, and we
consider it a duty no less than good policy on the part of
Government to give every facility of reference by the publication
of documents throwing light on the spirit and the manner in
which it deals with the dearest rights of the people. In this
view of the case, nothing, we imagine, can excuse the delay in
giving publicity to important documents relating to the
settlement of the various districts i n this Presidency.


There is another reason why the publication of papers on the
Ahmedabad zilla should have long preceded this Report on the
Kaira Collectorate, and that is, that many of the precedents of
settlement in the latter district have been taken from the former.
For instance, in the Report before us, reference is often made
by Col. Prescott and Mr. Pedder, the Settlement Officers, to
reports on the Dushkrohi and Jetulpur talookas of Ahmedabad,
and to the nurwadari village of Koobudthul, for certain principles
of assessment adopted and found to work satisfactorily there.
The reader, however, looks in vain for these reports in the
published records of Government.


Few districts of Western India seem to have preserved the hoary
traditions of the country so intact as the district of Kaira. To this
day you find in their full working order all the archaic forms of
the village community in India, in spite of the revolutions which
the country has undergone. So wedded have been the people—
especially, tho cultivating and landholding classes—to their old
traditions, that they have been found to make important
sacrifices rather than give up the system to which they have
instinctively clung as from father to son. It is no wonder, then, that
at the introduction of a revised settlement the chief anxiety on
the part of the people should be lest violent changes be made in
the new settlement that might seriously interfere with their social
status and importance. These apprehensions, groundless as they
were, seemed to derive some force from the manner in which the
revised settlement of land was conducted in other parts of the
Presidency, where the, desire of symmetry or uniformity made
<!-- Leaf 31, Page: 21 -->
by actual experiments the requisite processes for converting the
tobacco into cheroots. From the experiments conducted by
Mr. E. D. Robertson, in Dharwar and in Gujarat, there is little
doubt that the tobacco cultivation admits of considerable
improvement, which, if attained, cannot fail to be a source of
increased demand and of additional wealth to Gujarat.


But to return to tour subject. The rates of assessment, as
determined by the survey, do not press too heavily upon the people.
But it would be a great mistake to suppose that they are very
light, or admit of being indefinitely increased. Compared with
those fixed for other zillas in Gujarat, they are, perhaps, the
highest. For instance, the maximum dry-crop rate for the
seven patees of Neriad is Rs. 6-4-0 per acre—a rate seldom to
be met with in any talooka or kusba in the Presidency. It is
not with a view to complain of this that we bring forward this
circumstance to the notice of the reader. Our object is simply
to show that while the cultivator gets his due share of profit, the
Government is equally benefited, and that the revised rates are,
upon the whole, satisfactory to both parties.
<!-- Leaf 41, Page: 31 -->
to sketch the main principles of this tenure. The essence of the
Nurwa tenure I have shown to be a lump assessment (Oodhur
Jummabundy) and a joint responsibility on the part of the
village Mutadars or Headmen. Minute investigations into the
capabilities of the soil, the extent of each field, the quality and variety
of its products, the facilities for water enjoyed by it, its situation
as regards markets—-these and like enquiries were as foreign
to the spirit of the Nurwa tenure as they were to the character
of the Maratha Government under whose sway the system
obtained its full force. General considerations bearing upon the
richness of the soil, the nature of the crops, the good or bad
seasons through which the village community had passed, and
the prices of food, doubtless, influenced, to a certain extent, the
determination of the amount of this lump assessment. Other
circumstances, however, went far more to determine the amount
than a regard to dry-crop or garden-lands. Of these the
principal was the social character and position of the peasantry.
This was pre-eminently the case all over Gujarat under the
Maratha Government. A village of which the greater portion
consisted of Kunbi population invariably paid higher assessment
than another inhabited by Kolies, owing, very probably, to the
circumstance of the Kunbi being a far more skilful cultivator
than the Koli. The ability to pay the assessment was thus rated
far higher in the case of the Kunbi than in that of the Koli,
owing to the superior social position of the former over the latter.
This circumstance has had so powerful an influence upon the
land assessments of Gujarat that some consideration appears to
have been accorded to it even in the recent revision of
assessment effected by the British Government. Though our
settlement officers have not been guided by rules of caste
assessment, yet it is a notable feature of the Kaira settlement that the
Koli villages are more lightly assessed than those of which the
major portion has consisted of the Kunbi population.


The whims or caprices of settling officers as well as a regard
to the pressing necessities of native rulers had also much
to do with the settlement of the lump assessment. There is
therefore not the shadow of a doubt that in Nurwadari villages

assessment in Gujarat, the advisability of securing to the State this very
precarious source of revenue by the payment, once for all, of a lump sum,
is very apparent, and if, as Mr. Pedder suggests in his 4th paragraph, the
realisations by such sales could be applied to local improvements, there
can be no question the measure would be attended with the best results.


{empty}3. But the Superintendent fears that such sums would be considered
the price of the redemption of a certain portion of the Imperial land
revenue, and, consequently, not available for local purposes.


{empty}4. There is a doubt too what occupiers would think of the measure.
"Well assessment, however moderate it may be, is the least popular of
imposts upon land. It is paid because proprietary right is secured and
maintained by its payment, and occupiers would gladly relieve
themselves of the liability in the manner proposed if they could be convinced
that it is a really equitable arrangement as regards themselves as well as
the State. We may try to convince them that they are simply
redeeming a portion of the dues of the State, but they will think—  
  
  
  1st.—That they are purchasing a right which they have already


bought by the expenditure of their capital and labour on
Govern
ment property, for the idea of the natives of Gujarat is that he who

sinks a well has given something to the State, and,

2nd.—That they are purchasing a very precarious tenure in a well,

which may fall in any day—a few days after purchase even—thus

leaving them minus the means of building a new well, having
ex
pended their money in buying the perpetual right in the old one.

{empty}5. Everybody admits that the assessment of wells dug at the expense
of private individuals, and not by the State, is contrary to alt principle;
the question is only whether it is needful and whether the State will
suffer serious loss by dispensing with the extra assessment on land
irrigated by private enterprise.

Survey Act, will be so as regards wells not in existence at the
introduction of the settlement. But with regard to the assessment of wells now
in existence, the case is different. Even when they are held by the
persons who built them, it must be remembered that they were built
with the full knowledge that their construction would cause an increase
of assessment upon the lands they were to water. Many old wells also
in Gujarat were originally built by Government or by farmers of the
revenue, aud many more originally constructed by cultivators, have
either lapsed to Government or have been sold, their liability to
assessment having been considered in the price.


\"17. I speak with diffidence regarding the Deccan Survey system,
having had no experience in it. But from what I have heard I believe that
wells in the Deccan are comparatively few, that as they pierce the rock,
they are very lasting, and that the limits of the land irrigated from them
are generally well defined. If this is the case it is of course not-difficult
for the classers to decide what lands should be assessed at garden rates.


\"18. But this is not generally the case in Gujarat. Wells are very
numerous, are likely to fall in or become salt, and the area of land which
each is capable of irrigating annually is usually much less than the area
capable of being irrigated from it. There are generally several sharers
in a well, each of whom has the right of taking his own share of water
into his own field, often at a considerable distance from the well, and
surrounded by other fields equally capable of being irrigated, but the owners
of which have no right to the water. We have therefore to decide—

1st.—What area each well is capable of irrigating.

2nd.—What proportion of this area must be reckoned in the field of
each share; and

3rd.—The rate.

\"19. An example will show the method in which this was done
before we introduced the kussur system :—

We conclude for the present by stating the grounds of our objection
to the levy of this cess under the following definite propositions :—


First.—That neither the former nor the present Government levied
any charge on water in Government lands in the Kaira Zilla, or, perhaps,
in the whole of Gujarat


Secondly.—That the old wells upon which this charge is made were
constructed at the frequent solicitations of Revenue Officers (though, of
course, in the interest of the ryots) at the cost of the ryots, who invested
their capital in the improvement of their holdings, and the interest of
which capital they are fairly entitled to.


Thirdly.—That the levy is a direct breach on the part of the State of
the faith and assurance conveyed to the ryots in the circular of 1827 by
Mr. Thomas Williamson.


Fourthly.—That if recently constructed wells, or those to be
constructed in future, are exempted from the cess, there is no reason why old
wells, simply because they are old, should not have the benefit of the
exemption. If the principle of not taxing them, because they are
improvements, be good to-day, it was equally good ten, twenty, or thirty
years ago.


Fifthly.—That the levy is opposed to the principle of the Narwadari
feaure, as it obtained under the former Government, and also under the
present Government before the new survey came into operation.


Sixthly.—That it is opposed to the liberal and enlightened policy of
Government's indicated in the recent Resolution0 of the present
Government, in the matter of the Indapoor talooka, which it is not too much to
ask, should form the basis of our survey settlements in Gujarat as well
as in the Deccan.


Seventhly.—That it is a burden on the industry of a most active and
useful class of agriculturists in Gujarat, and is opposed to the economic
principles of modern times.


Eighthly.—That while water is the most crying want of Gujarat, as of
other parts of India, the utmost exertions of Government Bhould be used
in affording every encouragement to promote means of irrigation.

Ninthly.—That the cess is not a moderate one as it is supposed to be
but is actually very heavy.


Tenthly, and lastly.—That while legislative facilities are given, or are
about to be given, for land improvements in other parts of India, the
present policy of the New Survey would seem to be a retrograde step, in
his as well as in other districts of this Presidency.

\"be that which governs our taxation of the land itself; that
"is the capability of being used rather than the use itself. If
\"water of good quality be easily available near the surface, it is
\"more reasonable to tax such land by a light additional rate,
\"whether the water be used or not, than to lay an oppressively
\"heavy tax on those who expend capital and labor in bringing
\"the water into use. There is, however, a point at which this
principle must be modified, for when the land is such that when
\"water is not brought to it, it will bear nothing; and when water
\"is used it will yield a fine crop, than even a light tax in the
for" mer case is impossible. Of this class are the sandy tracts in the
\"Konkan which under the influence of water become cocoanut
\"gardens. It must be held that the right of Government to levy
•' a rate by virtue of tbe water below the surface, is in abeyance
\"or dormant till the water is produced, but it is doubted
\"greatly, even in this extreme case, whether it is politic, though
"it may be asserted to be just, to levy more than would be
\"leviable from first class rice ground; which enjoys also the
"benefit of water, not created, it is true, by the tenant, but
\"utilized by means of his preparation of the gound."


If these views had been acted upon in respect of wells in
Gujarat, there would be little cause of complaint on the part of
the cultivating and land-owning classes. It could be easily
shown that there are districts in Gujarat, and notably in Kaira
Zilla, where land is such that when water is not brought to it it
will bear nothing; and when water is used it will yield a fine
crop, so that even a light tax in the former case is impossible.
How the question was settled in Gujarat, and what the ryots,
on the one hand, whose interests have been deeply affected by it,
have to urge on their behalf, and what apology the Revenue
Survey Officers have to offer on behalf of the mode which they
have sought to adopt, will appear in the sequel.
<!-- Leaf 52, Page: 42 -->
individuals, and not by the State, is contrary to all principle;
the question is only whether it is needful, and whether the State
will suffer serious loss by dispensing with the extra assessment
on land irrigated by private enterprise." To this it may be said
that if regard to the State's needs and to the State's losses were
the sole standard of determining the justice or otherwise of the
levy of a cess, any tax may be justified and made to look fair.
But even taking the most selfish view in savour of the State,
Major Prescott is ' very respectfully' of opinion that the State need
not lose anything by dispensing altogether with the cess on pucka
wells in Gujarat at future settlements, and I may add—even in
current settlements,—since the sacrifice involved is infinitely
small compared with the impetus that the measure is likely to
give to irrigation.


The levy of well-assessment in future being wisely, in
conformity with the considerations above set forth, given up,
there is indeed no justification for its present continuance on old
wells. In fact the assumption on which it has proceeded when
taken in connexion wdth the water facilities of the whole of
Gujarat is entirely erroneous. Major Prescott takes for granted
facts which are not true of the whole of Gujarat, but only of
certain tracts of land in a certain zilla of Gujarat. Such
statements on his part as that " good water is almost everywhere
procurable in the alluvial soil of Gujarat at from 20 to 30 feet
below the surface of the soil;" and again in another place, " that
water in the soil—and very close to ihe surface is a gift
of nature almost peculiar to the province of Gujarat—such
statements, I say, made by an officer, who certainly ought to
have known the country better, are surprising enough, and
mischievous—because they are used as general facts to establish the
justice and propriety of the levy of a well-tax; since having
made the above statements as regards the facilities of water
supply in Gujarat, Major Prescott at once, in the very next
sentence, comes to the conclusion, namely, " It (water) ought
therefore to be considered as one of the fertilizing elements of
the soil, and its value incorporated and included in the soil
assessment whenever it is practicable." Now, the conclusion, with
<!-- Leaf 10 -->
by the removal of the cess, a circumstance which will not only result
in an increase in the number of wells in that Zilla, but will afford an
impetus to garden cultivation, now checked on account of the heavy
and unjust impost.


It may be mentioned here that all the articles, except No. VI,
originally appeared at different times in the Times of India, from which
they are collected and reprinted, with slight alterations, in the present
form at the request of a few friends interested in the economical
questions therein discussed. The last two articles on well assessment
have been entirely recast. The writer will consider his object gained
in some measure if the attention of Government is drawn to the
impolicy of retaining any longer a cess on wells.

constant disputes which arose on account of the non-payment
of the Government demand. Processes of Civil Courts, sales
of lands, or shares of estates, and confiscation of moveable and
immoveable property belonging to the Nurwadars were the
features of the time. Each zilla Collector kept himself so secluded
from his brother officer in the vicinity, that common action on
any important question connected with revenue management
was hardly possible. Thus every Collector pursued a system ho
thought best adapted to the zilla under his charge. A survey of
lands was at last resolved upon by Government, by the
appointment of Major Cruickshank and Colonel Melvill as Revenue
Surveyors of Gujarat thirty-five years ago. These gentlemen
executed a rough survey of the Ahmedabad and Kaira zillas. This
was in 1825. A similar survey of Broach zilla was also
conducted under Lieut.-Colonel Monier Williams. The reports of
these gentlemen contain valuable information regarding the
condition of Gujarat at that period of British rule. They showed but
too plainly how much there was yet to be done in the matter
of a systematic revenue settlement of the country.


This state of things continued for some time. It was evident,
however, that a comprehensive system of land survey and
settlement, based upon equitable principles, and a due regard to the
interests of the ryots as well of the State was sorely needed to
place the revenue management upon a sound footing. This
system could be no other than that projected by Captain, now Sir
George, Wingate, and the late Mr. Goldsmid, and introduced for
the first time with admirable results into the Dekkan. Accordingly,
about five and twenty years ago, the beginning of aland
settlement upon the principles of the new survey was made in the
district ofDholka, in the Ahmedabad Collectorate. The settlement
of this zilla presented no new features, at least none that differed
from those met with in the Dekkan. The greater portion of land
was held directly from the State, the rest being owned by talookdars.


It was, however, in the settlement of the second zilla of
Gujarat, namely, Kaira, that the Survey Department met with
features of tenures different from those found in Ahmedabad. How
these were dealt with we shall see hereafter.

The appointment of a Tahiti, or village accountant, in every
village owned by Government was the first important change
that immediately followed the transfer of power from the
Maiathas to the British. The duty of the Talati was to keep a
record of all the lands of his village—irrigated, dry crop, or
waste; to record the rights of the several occupants thereof; to
collect, in conjunction with the mukhi, or chief patel, the
Government assessment on them, and to keep an account of the same,
paying the money thus collected into the Mamlutdar's treasury,
to which he was responsible. In Nurwadari or Bhagdari villages
the management of mujmoon lands was transferred from the
Narwadars to the Talatis of those villages. All rents of
mujmoon lands which were hitherto collected by the Mutadars, or
principal sharers, began to be collected by the Talati, who
passed to the credit of the Narwadars such sums as they were
entitled to. The Nurwadars had to pay the balance of the sums
due by them on account of the lump assessment, which remained
after the collections from the rents of the mujmoon lands were
deducted from the total amount. Such a transfer of the right
of collecting revenue certainly involved an invasion of the
privileges of the Nurwadars, which could be defended on no
principle of justice or expediency. The practical effect of it, however,
was to free the Nurwadars from the management of common
lands, which to them was hitherto more a source of loss than of
gain. Hence the change was not looked upon by the joint
communities in tho light of a violation of their rights. In fact
they were hardly able to pay their own assessments.


In the history of rural Gujarat, the early years of British rule
present a dismal and uninviting spectacle, owing to an
unprecedented decline in the value of agricultural produce. The
peasantry was rack-rented, as we said, under the Maratha rule.
And the British Government took up the revenue system as they
found it. It was soon discovered, however, that in directly
managed holdings, of which the rent was payable to
Government, the ryots found the burdens too heavy for them to bear.
In Nurwadari villages also the records of those times bear
witness to the miserable condition of the proprietary body, and to the
<!-- Leaf 14, Page: 4 -->
the zilla of Ahmedabad, and on the north, part of the Gaekwar's
territory. The Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway
runs through the heart of the zilla, affording peculiar facilities
for the conveyance of produce and ready markets where it can
be disposed of. There are situated in this zilla, the rapidly
rising stations of Wassind, Anund, Neriad, and Mehmoodabad.
Besides the regular through passenger and goods trains, local
trains are daily running to and fro between Ahmedabad and
Baroda on the one hand, and Baroda and Bulsar on the other.
So great has been the demand of passenger traffic in this
particular zilla, that the Baroda Railway has found it necessary to
open five new stations on the line from the commencement of
this year. Of these, as many as four stations,—Batwa, Nowley
Borehavi, and Khumbhali,—are for passengers in the Kaira
zilla, the fifth being the traffic station on the Saburmuttee Bridge,
the present terminal point of the Railway.


Tho soil of this zilla is of a light sandy character, technically
termed goraroo in the native language. Beds of besm—a mixture
of goraroo with black loam—are also to be met with frequently.
Cultivation seems to have reached its extreme limits in this zilla,
considering the largest portion of culturable area actually under
plough in some of the rich talookas. Bor instance, there is 95
per cent, of land actually in cultivation in the Neriad talooka,
and the same may be said, more or less, of other pergunnahs.
This phenomenon may be said to be quite unparalleled in any
district of the Presidency, I might say, in India. And closely
connected with this, and in fact chiefly accounting for it, is
another fact as regards the density of its population, being a
pressure of 334 per square mile—a proportion exhibited by no
other zilla in the Bombay Presidency. In some of the talookas

—as, for instance, in Neriad—the pressure of population is 522
souls to a square mile, a phenomenon unparalleled even in Europe,
where the most thickly populated country, Belgium, exhibits a
proportion of 380 to the square mile. The supply of land being
limited and the population being mostly agricultural, it is no
wonder that a keen competition and enquiry should make
land an exceedingly valuable article, and lead to the cultivation
<!-- Leaf 61, Page: 51 -->
but it is clear we must do it 30 years hence." But why wait till
30 years and not give up the revenue at once, when it is clear,
1st, that the amount is not very large, being hardly over
Rs. 50,000 for the entire Northern Division; and, 2ndly, when
the levy is so unjustifiable and oppressive ? If the remission,
which is certain to be made after 30 years, will do any good at all, it
will do more at the present moment. The immediate effect of the
Government giving up the cess would, in my opinion, be to induce
the owners of the wells now falling in or getting out of repairs to
put them at once into a sound state, and thus to promote irrigation.


Thirdly, no provisions exist at present to obviate the dire
effects of famine in Gujarat, should it unfortunately ever break
out. The best possible remedy, and one peculiarly adapted for
the country to avoid or mitigate the effects of famine in Gujarat,
is well irrigation. If that is extensively carried on in the
country, the ryots would be in a position to raise wet crops, or at
least (judging from their remarkable agricultural skill and habits
of perseverance) would do as much as it would lay in their
power, to put forth such crops as would stand them well in a bad
season. It must be said that Government is literally doing
nothing in this respect in Gujarat. What the province sadly
wants at present is some mechanical contrivance which would
enable the ryot to raise water much more easily from wells than
he can afford to do at present. Instead of encouraging the
adoption of some such mechanical contrivance as a pump
workable by bullock power and capable of drawing water from a depth
of 90 feet below the surface of the soil, by calling upon the
machinists of England and offering a premium for such
invention—instead of doing this, I say, it throws positive obstacles in
the way of increased production in Gujarat by the levy of a
notoriously unpopular impost upon wells constructed by the ryots
out of the savings of their hard-earned labour. Such a charge
on capital is, to say the least, utterly incompatible with any
theory of rent known in political economy.

It is the more necessary that the question should be settled
without any delay now when it is considered that no suitable
means exist at present a3 shewn above which will provide for
